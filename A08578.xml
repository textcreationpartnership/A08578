            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

partially out of affection, yet I hope I may without blame give teſtimony to that truth which all that knew him will acknowledge; namely, that hee was a faithfull labourer in the worke of the Lord, a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that needed not to bee aſhamed, a burning and a ſhining light, burning with zeale, ſhining both by divine Doctrine and godly converſation. Burning ſo, as he conſumed himſelfe, to give light to others; and ſhining, not onely before his Parochiall charge, where hee lived and exerciſed his Miniſtery; being as an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

Neither was the luſtre of his light confined in that Pariſh or Country wherein hee lived, but ſhined further into other parts of this Kingdome, ſo as three very Godly and Eminent Perſons in this State; worthy inſtruments of Gods glory, floriſhing in their time with many excellent graces and vertues on earth, and now all ſhining glorious Saints in Heaven, did take notice of him, and did ſucceſſively entertaine him Chaplaine (namely, Sir <hi>Francis Walſhingham,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the State, Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> Lord-Chiefe-Iuſtice of England, and Sir <hi>Henry Hobart,</hi> Knight and Baronet, Lord Chiefe-Iuſtice of the Common Pleas;) all which notwithſtanding, hee continued ſo lowly in his owne eyes, and ſo zealous in his Function, as hee neither careleſly, nor ambitiouſly, left his Cure to ſeeke other preferment: But having at any time performed his due obſervance to thoſe Honorable Perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as hee was engaged, hee preſently returned to his accuſtomed weekely, and almoſt daily taske of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: for his heart was ſo inflamed with the zeale of Gods glory, and yet ſo ballanced with the feare of God, and true humility, that neither the learning nor graces that were in his owne heart, nor the luſtre and

grace he had with other, did puffe him up with price: and this humility and lowlines in his owne eyes <hi>(Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; rara virtus,</hi> as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> tearmes it) made him thinke neither theſe nor any of his Sermons or writings worthy of publike view, ſo as though hee were much importuned by offers and earneſt entreaties, yet would not be drawne to publiſh any of them. But for as much as it is not meete, thoſe learned labours ſhould dye with him, whereby, hee being dead, may (with <hi>Abel)</hi> yet ſpeake, and the living bee furthered in the way of life, I reſolved to publiſh theſe Sermons upon S. <hi>Iude,</hi> Preached in a weekly Lecture to a publike audience on the market day at <hi>Northwalſham</hi> in <hi>Norfolke;</hi> Intending (God aſſiſting) if I may underſtand theſe to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable &amp; profitable to the people of God, to publiſh more.

               <p>Secondly, he proceeds to the ſecond Attribute of Saviour, and ſhewes that this is the moſt comfortable to us, and that he ſaves by Chriſt, yea, that the name of Saviour is proper to Chriſt, who purchaſed ſalvation for us by his death, that we muſt therefore bee thankefull to him, not derogate from his glory (as the Papiſts doe) minſing Chriſts merits, and mixing with it their owne, and aſcribing too much to nature and free will.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth to the third Attribute of God, namely, Glory; that this is an acceptable Sacrifice to God, but neglected by us; we pray in our wants, not praiſe God when they be ſupplyed: that wee ought to performe this duty continually, and if we doe not glorifie God here, we ſhall not be glorified with him hereafter. He reprooves two ſorts that rob God of his glory, the Proud, and the Envious. We muſt not imitate them, but praiſe God alwayes in all things, with all the parts of our bodies and powers of our ſoule.</p>

               <p>HEre he proceeds to the other three Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi> Majeſty, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and Power; and ſheweth what it is firſt to aſcribe Majeſty to God: that it is to acknowledge his Majeſty and Greatneſſe in all his Workes, and reprooves our dulneſſe that admire onely his Miracles, when all his Workes declare his Majeſtie. Many regard not his Miracles, nor ſignes of his wrath.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to the fifth, namely, Dominion; and ſheweth that to conſiſt in that authority, whereby he commands in all Kingdomes, Places, Perſons; and he diſtinguiſheth theſe into three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> his kingdome of 1 Power. 2 Grace. 3 Glory. and deſcribes them: But inſiſteth in his Kingdome of Grace within us, and reprooves our rebellions and trecheries, that yeeld ſubjection to ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſet up our owne wills and luſts to beare rule in us, and ſo make a mocke of Chriſts Kingdome, and that wee ought to ſubject as the Angels, and doe his will as they, moſt willingly, ſpeedily, and faithfully.

He proceeds to the ſixth and loſt Attribute, of Power; and ſheweth that this conſiſteth in that he doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in all places and perſons, being preſent in all places by his power, though not in body, and that this is an aſcribing Power to him, to depend upon his Power, and to truſt to his Strength, being all-ſufficient: after that, hee obſerveth all the ſixe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to belong to the whole Trinity, and that for ever. Laſtly, hee ſheweth the divers ſignifications of <hi>Amen,</hi> and therewith, how powerfull a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is in all prayers, implying in it faith and zeale in him that prayeth.</p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 20.</note> their pens to write, ſo that it was not they that wrote, but the holy Ghoſt by them. By this therefore it evidently appeareth, of what reverent account this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ought for to bee, ſeeing it hath the holy Ghoſt for the <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The <hi>penman</hi> or writer was <hi>Iude,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of this name our Saviour had two diſciples: The one called <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> Who for thirty peeces of ſilver betraied, &amp; baſely ſold his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Servus Dominum, diſcipulus magiſtrum, homo Deum, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The other called <hi>Iudas,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Alphaeas,</hi> called alſo <hi>Thaddeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Labbeus,</hi> who was brother to <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; coſin to the Lord Ieſus, in the fleſh: The occaſion of which name, with the reaſon therof, is ſet down in the 29. of <hi>Gen.</hi> the 35, <hi>V.</hi> For when <hi>Leah</hi> had borne <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Iude</hi> was as rare and notable an Apoſtle to beat downe the Heretickes of that time, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as <hi>Apollo</hi> did the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as <hi>Stephen</hi> did the <hi>Libertines</hi> &amp; <hi>Cirenians,</hi> as <hi>Paphuntius</hi> did the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> in Miniſters marriage.</p>

Concerning the <hi>Argument,</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> it is a ſtirring <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or this Epiſtle.</note> them up to a Chriſtian life, to ſhew foorth the fruits of faith to ioyne with Words, Workes, with communication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with hearing, keeping, with profeſſion, practice: For after planting muſt come growing, after light walking <note place="margin">

               <p>Beſide, here in this Epiſtle, hee inveigheth ſharpely againſt carnall profeſſion, and groſſe abuſing of Chriſtian Religion. And alſo he admoniſheth them to beware of impoſters, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, falſe teachers, cunning deceivers, which were craftily crept in amongſt them, drawing men from purity in Religion to impurity of the fleſh: Whom the Apoſtle lively painteth out in their ſeverall colours, and againſt whom hee denounceth many Iudgements of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>occaſion</hi> of writing this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> was this; It is affirmed by the moſt learned of all times, and agreed upon by the beſt writers, that this Apoſtle <hi>Iude,</hi> outlived many (yea moſt) of the Apoſtles, continuing and preaching in <hi>Meſopotomia, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Perſis,</hi> and other parts of the world, till the Reigne of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour; in whoſe reigne Iniquity reigned, Impiety abounded, corruption of manners and diſſolution in life raged in every place; for many there were, that were Wantons in manners, and heretikes in opinion, againſt whom <hi>hee did lift up his voyce like a trumpet.</hi> So that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is notable, and <hi>written for our learning;</hi> howſoever ſome deny, this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to bee <hi>Cannonicall;</hi> as <hi>Cardinall Cajetane,</hi> who <note place="margin">

So that there was no cauſe for <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Reigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> to pearch on their rowſes, to clap their wings, to crow ſo lowd, to whet their dogges eloquence againſt us.

               <p>God hath kept the Scriptures in all ages, ſo much as is neceſſary for our ſalvation. At the giving of the Law, it was reſerved in tables of ſtone. After the giving of the Law the writings of the Prophets were nailed to the doore of the Temple, and reſerved in the Lords treaſury. Before the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity the Septuagint turned them into Greeke, and <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi>

In the primative Church, the Goſpell of <hi>Mathew</hi> was kept in <hi>Iewry,</hi> the Goſpell of <hi>Marke</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that of <hi>Luke</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Apocalips</hi> at <hi>Epheſus: Nam triplex eſt munus Eccleſiae,</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches office is threefold; <hi>Sacros libros ſervare inſtar teſtis, eos pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgare instar proeconis, eos ab aliis diſcernere;</hi> to keepe theſe ſacred bookes as a witneſſe, to promulgate them, as a Preacher, and to diſcerne them from other bookes whatſoever. And thus the Church hath kept this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Iude,</hi> unto this day. <hi>Fremat licet C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, The title or ſuperſcription.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Exordium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A propoſition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Exhortations, and dehortations.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The <hi>concluſion,</hi> or the ſhutting up of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> with a prayer to God.</p>
               <p>But firſt to begin with the title or ſuperſcription, and therein obſerve with me three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The perſon writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The perſons written unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Salutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the perſon writing is deſcribed three wayes<hi>:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt by his name, <hi>Iude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By his calling, <hi>a ſervant of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, By his kindred, <hi>The brother of</hi> Iames.</p>
               <p>But firſt, the perſon writing is deſcribed by his name, and that was <hi>Iude,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> not <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> the traytor, but <hi>Iudas</hi> the brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> and Couſin to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh, yet both were the Apoſtles of Chriſt, but this man good

and godly, that wicked and ungodly: For it is nor the name or <note place="margin">The Writer by his name and calling deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> office that makes a good man; but the Grace and Mercie of God; If outward titles could make good men, <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> had beene as good as this Apoſtle, Nay better, for <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> was Chriſts ſteward, his purſebearer, disburſer of all things for Chriſt and his company, and yet a theefe, a traytor, a devill: <hi>Non omnes filii Sanctorum, qui loca ſancta tenent. They are not all the ſonnes of Saints, nor Saints themſelves, which hold the places of Saints.</hi> God oftentimes beſtoweth upon wicked men lofty titles and high places, partly to their greater condemnation; the mighty, ſhall be mightily tormented; and partly for the puniſhment of ungratefull people, as <hi>Saul</hi> over the Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>Againe, in that <hi>Iude</hi> was not aſhamed of his name, but in the very firſt inſcription of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſetteth downe his name, wee which are the Miniſters of God are taught, not to be aſhamed of our calling, though ſcornefully by ſcorners of Religion, wee are termed <hi>Prieſts.</hi> The Iewes though they mocked Chriſt, when bowing their knees, they cryed, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes,</hi> againſt their wils they honoured him; for indeed he was King of the Iewes, and of the Gentiles: So theſe graceleſſe contemners of our glorious calling, when they thinke to vilifie us, by calling us <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (againſt their wils) they magnifie us: their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull ſcoffes ſhould not daunt us, nor diſcourage us in our calling, for he that hath called us and ſent us, will bee with us, as hee was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as he was with <hi>Ieremie. Be not affraid</hi>

                  <hi>of their faces, I will be with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>perſon</hi> writing is deſcribed by his calling, for he calleth himſelfe, <hi>Servum Dei, The ſervant of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of ſervants there bee three ſorts: Some are ſervants by <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> and <hi>voluntary ſubjection;</hi> theſe the Apoſtle calls, <hi>The ſervants of ſinne; Qui facit peccatum ſervus eſt peccati; He which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>committeth ſinne, is the ſervant of ſinne,</hi> and they which ſerve ſinne, <hi>Duram ſerviunt ſervitutem, ſerve an hard ſervice, for the wages of ſinne is Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There be ſervants by <hi>condition;</hi> which are either born ſuch by nature, or taken captives in Warre, or bought with money. To theſe ſervants, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Servants obey thoſe which are your Maſters, according to the fleſh, with feare and</hi>

                  <hi>trembling, and with ſimplicitie of heart, not with eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt: Nomen iſtud culpâ mervit, non natura, This name of ſervant not nature but ſinne deſerved;</hi> For the name of ſervant was never heard of, till <hi>Noah</hi> curſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> Who diſcovered his fathers nakedneſſe, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be Canaan, a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he bee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Servants by <hi>Office,</hi> Calling and Profeſſion, and theſe are of two ſorts; for men are either the ſervants of God generally, or particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15606:19"/>
Generally, they are Gods ſervants, which acknowledge <note place="margin">

               <p>Calling is of two ſorts; Externall. Internall.</p>
               <p>Externall, is either common to all, by the inſtinct of nature, and workes of God, or not common to all, by the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>Internall and effectuall, is the worke of the whole Trinitie, whereby God the Father, through the Sonne, by the holy Ghoſt,

               <p>This hath two parts; The one, Invitement. The other, Admiſſion.</p>
               <p>Invitement is, when God offers remiſſion, and life everlaſting to all that doe beleeve, and this outwardly by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, and inwardly by inſpiration of heavenly deſires.</p>
               <p>Admiſſion is, when men are entred into the kingdome of Grace, and this outwardly by Baptiſme, and inwardly by the ſpirit, engraffing them into Chriſt, and making them reall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Of this effectuall calling ſpeaketh <hi>Iude</hi> here, the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the World, <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Spiritus Dei non amittitur totaliter &amp; finaliter, quos ſemel,</hi>

This word muſt bee unto us dearer than thouſands of ſilver and gold, more precious than the gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi> ſweeter than the Honey, or the Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe: For albeit God can onely, by the inward motion of his bleſſed Spirit, worke out, make-ſure, and perfect our ſalvation; yet it pleaſeth him in his eternall wiſedome, to uſe the word as an ordinary meanes of our vocation and ſalvation. As then God giveth learning by ſtudy, wiſedome by experience, riches by travell, and like things by like meanes: ſo he maketh perfect the calling of his Saints, by the preaching of the Word, which <note place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond title of honour given here to the Saints, is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; he calleth them ſanctified of God the Father: this is the next grace wherewith he adorneth them. For God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth his graces, as <hi>Iacob</hi> continued his wraſtling, as <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his knocking till they let him in: and God will not leave calling and working till hee hath ſanctified and perfected his graces; like the Sunne that never leaveth ſhining, but <hi>commeth</hi>

               <p>Sanctification wrought by us, is that, whereby wee ſanctifie and make holy the outward works and actions of our life. This the Lord requireth, <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> To this Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>Here the ſlander of the Papiſts is anſwered for Juſtification, for whom God calleth, he juſtifieth; and whom hee iuſtifieth, he ſanctifieth: We preach not an idle faith, as they ſay, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning windowes and doores to all wickedneſſe, by a <hi>Solifidian</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and an imputative Iuſtice.

               <p>Iuſtification and Sanctification goe together, yet wee enter not into heaven chiefely as wee are ſanctified and regenerated: For that is but in part, but as wee are iuſtified by the death and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is perfect, compleat, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.

But I deny the Argument, they reaſon like blind men, the light of righteouſneſſe hath not ſhined on them, they feed on aſhes. For many things are conioyned, which yet have diverſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as the light and heat of the Sunne, where the one is there is the other, yet are we not warmed by the light, but by the heat, nor yet directed by the heat, but by the light of it. <hi>Fides eſt ſola, at non ſolitaria, ſola in actu juſtificationis, at non ſolitaria in uſu &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratione quotidiana, nam operatur per dilectionem;</hi> Faith is alone but not ſolitary, alone in the act of iuſtification, but not alone in the uſe and daily operation, for it worketh by love, or as <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> reaſoneth againſt <hi>Andradius,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> We have eyes and eares at once, and they are ioynt members of the body, yet we heare not with our eyes, and ſee not with our eares; <hi>Manus non eſt ſola, ſed coniuncta cum reliquiis membris, at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſola ſcribit;</hi> the hand is not alone, but ioyned with the other members, but the hand alone writeth; the tongue is not alone, nor ſevered from the reſt of the members, yet the tongue alone ſpeaketh; the Prince goeth not without the Court, yet the Prince ruleth alone, and not the Court; <hi>Fidem &amp; opera coniungi magis quam confundi vellem,</hi> I had rather conioine faith and works than confound them.

               </p>
               <p>Iuſtification is that, wherby we being delivered before God of the guiltineſſe of ſin, are accounted juſt. For, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing</hi>

               <p>Now for Sanctification, whereby God beginneth in us holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that hath two members: Mortification to ſinne, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Mortification is the firſt part, whereby the power of ſinne is killed in us; and of this Mortification <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Our old man is crucified within, that the body of ſinne might bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that henceforth wee ſhould not ſerve ſinne.</hi> And againe, <hi>That</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Reſurrection unto righteouſneſſe is, whereby ſanctity, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is really inherent, and begun in us, and is increaſed dayly more and more.

               </p>
               <p>This Sanctification, being the ſecond principall part of our Redemption, is the quallity, whereby Gods ſpirit doth renew us, and begin in us newneſſe of life: but it is not perfect, <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> in us. <hi>Paenitentia &amp; amor ſequuntur noticiam noſtram:</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Love follow our Knowledge, but our knowledge is <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9.</note> but in part. And this I note againſt the blaſphemy of <hi>Oſiander,</hi> who ſaith that the eſſentiall righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is in us: but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is without us, not within us, and is apprehended by Faith. And therefore <hi>Pauls</hi> care was to bee found in him, that is in Chriſt, <hi>Not having</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) mine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>own righteouſnes, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, even the righteouſneſſe which is of God through Faith.</hi> For the righteouſneſſe whereby wee are juſtified, is the meere impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts worke unto us: and therefore this word Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is tenne times recited in one Chapter. When a friend <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> of his owne goods and not of mine, payeth debt that I owe, that payment, or ſatisfaction is mine, it is imputed to mee, when as yet it is the worke of my friend, and none of mine. After the ſame manner, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is ours. This righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe therefore, whereby wee are juſtified, is Grace and not Nature; Imputation, not Eſſence; it is a Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15606:31"/>
of the benefit of Chriſt, not a commixion of eſſence: it is <note place="margin">Holineſſe is ſaid in diverſe ſenſes.</note> an effect of the proper worke of Chriſt, <hi>non ſubſtantia ipſa Chriſti;</hi> not the very ſubſtance of Chriſt. The other righteouſneſſe, wherewith he ſanctifieth us, is but begun onely, it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: For as the Sunne ſhineth, and as the fire warmeth us, and yet doe not transferre their eſſence into us: So Chriſt doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and ſanctifie us by the vertue of his Spirit, <hi>(quo homo &amp; Deus eſt)</hi> as he is man and God, not as he is man alone, or as he is God alone; and yet he doth not transferre his eſſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: and therefore <hi>Oſiander</hi> is much deceived. The place of <hi>Paul,</hi> quoted by him, helpeth him nothing; for we are the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</note> of Chriſt, <hi>ut ille fuit peccatum pro nobis,</hi> as he was ſinne for us: but ſinne was not really in Chriſt, no more is Chriſts righteouſneſſe really in us, but onely imputatively: faith as the hand applyeth it unto us, and flyeth into heaven, and there maketh us partakers of his Sanctity. Our faith wraſtleth with God in heaven, our charity wraſtleth with men here below on earth; both of them are exerciſed, neither idle nor unfruitfull: and therefore the Apoſtle joyneth, <hi>Faith in Chriſt and love toward</hi>

                  <hi>all Saints</hi> together. O Brethren, how many bee there that can tell a ſmooth tale of Chriſt, and yet cannot ſpeak one wiſe word of Iuſtification and Sanctification; and yet <hi>Peter</hi> requireth it of all.</p>
               <p>Hence am I to derive an exhortation to all men to holineſſe and ſanctification, ſeeing that <hi>Rahabs</hi> houſe was knowne by a <note place="margin">

Every child of God is ſanctified, <hi>Secundum plus aut minus,</hi> either more or leſſe. But firſt let me ſpeake of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe acceptions of the word, <hi>ne inpingamus ubi non eſt lapis,</hi> leſt we ſtumble where there is no ſtone.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is taken for that which is pure and perfect and cleane: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 2.</note> So God alone is ſaid to be holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is taken for that which is lawfull, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>The unbeleeving husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your children uncleane, but now they are holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For that which is ſeparated and ſet apart from common uſes, and reſerved to ſacred and holy uſes. Thus in the Law, thoſe things were called holy and ſanctified, which were taken from the common uſe of the people, and ſet apart for the uſe and ſervice of God; as the Oyle, Shew bread; firſt fruits, veſſels of the Tabernacle. In this ſenſe the Prieſts were called holy, becauſe they were ſeparate from the common life of men, to ſerve in the Tabernacle. Thus the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeparated from the reſt of the Nations, were called by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a ſanctified people to the Lord; and by <hi>Ieremy,</hi> a thing hallowed to the Lord.</p>

4. For that which is conſecrated to a godly and holy uſe: <note place="margin">Wee muſt bee holy becauſe God is holy.</note> In which reſpect it is oppoſite to prophaneneſſe.

               <p n="5">5. It is taken for purity of body and minde; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. So it is taken here.</p>
               <p>And that wee ſhould bee holy, that is, pure both in body and in minde, it is the will and commandement of God.

               <p>There be many reaſons to move us to Sanctification, to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; whereof one is often uſed, drawne from the perſon of God our Father; that children muſt reſemble their Father, elſe are they Baſtards rather than ſonnes.

Another reaſon is taken from the end of our Redemption, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Holineſſe the end of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: without it wee ſhall not ſee God.</note> by the Apoſtle, ſaying; <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all men, hath appeared, and teacheth us, that we ſhould deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and worldly luſts, and that wee ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and holily in this preſent world.</hi> Hath Chriſt ſweat water and blood? hath his heart beene molten like waxe? his ſtrength dryed up <note place="margin">

               <p>Another reaſon is taken from our Salvation, for without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe we cannot be ſaved. For though wee be not ſaved for it, yet we are not ſaved without it.

               <p>For all our ſanctification and holineſſe is from the Lord, as it appeareth plainely by the words of my Text; <hi>Sanctified of God the Father: Cauſa efficiens ſanctitatis;</hi> the efficient cauſe of holineſſe is God the Father: <hi>Inſtrumentalis cauſa fides;</hi> the inſtrumentall cauſe is Faith; for, <hi>Fides cor purificat,</hi> Faith purifieth the heart. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialis cauſa,</hi> the materiall cauſe, <hi>est energia ſanctitatis quae eſt in</hi>

               <p>But yet obſerve with mee, that though ſanctification bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Father, yet the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt are not excluded: for wee hold the principle of the Schoolemen; <hi>Opera Trinitatis quoad extra ſunt indiviſa;</hi> the outward workes of God are common to the whole Trinity; and ſo are we ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: yet ſanctification is here aſcribed to the Father, as being the ground and firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof. For the Son ne ſanctifieth by meriting ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the holy Ghoſt ſanctifieth by working it; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſanctifieth, both by ſending his Sonne to merit it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by giving the holy Spirit to worke. Thus <hi>Opera Trinitatis,</hi> the outward workes of God are common to the whole Trinitie. <hi>Sed opera Trinitatis, quoad intus eſſe ſingularia;</hi> the inward workes of God are ſingular, and proper to ſome perſons of the Trinitie: <hi>Vt patri potentia, filio redemptio, ſpiritu ſanctificatio tribuitur;</hi> as power is aſcribed to the Father, redemption to the Sonne, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to the holy Ghoſt: and yet theſe three now and then bee attributed to all the three perſons. <hi>Quod Vrſinus; ſervato or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine agendi,</hi> for as the Father and the holy Ghoſt doe redeeme, and yet mediately by the Sonne, ſo the Father and the Sonne doe ſanctifie, yet mediately by the Holy Ghoſt. The proper or incommunicable workes of the Trinity, are the inward eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and hypoſtaticall properties, as thus, <hi>Pater generat,</hi> the Father
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15606:33"/>
begetteth, the Sonne is begotten, and the holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <note place="margin">Diſtinction of perſons in the Trinitie.</note> and yet the Father is not the Sonne, nor the Sonne the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt either Father or Sonne. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of the Trinity are indiviſible, how ſoever ſometimes diſtinct, as Creation to the Father, Redemption to the Sonne, Sanctification to the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſayth thus; <hi>Pater ut fons, filius ut flumen, ſpiritus ut rivus ab utroque procedens;</hi> The Father as the Fountaine, the Sonne as the flood, the Spirit as the River proceeding from them both. The fountaine is not the flood, nor the flood the fountaine, nor the river either foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or flood, and yet all theſe bee one water. So the Father is not the Sonne, nor the Sonne the Father, nor the Spirit either Father or Sonne; and yet but one God. <hi>Et hi tres ſanctificant,</hi> and all theſe three ſanctifie: quoth <hi>Lactantius. Ab uno omnia, per unum omnia, in uno omnia, a quo, per quem, in quo omnia, unus a ſe unus ab uno, unus ab ambobus; una tamen &amp; eadem operatio?</hi> All things from one, all things by one, all things in one: from whom, by whom, and in whom are all things: one of himſelfe, one from one, one from both, and yet one and the ſame operation. <hi>Tres ſunt in trinitate, non ſtatu, ſed ordine, non eſſentia, ſed forma, non poteſtate, ſed ſpecie, unus ſtatus, eſſentiae &amp; poteſtatis, quia ſunt unus Deus.</hi> There bee three perſons in the Trinity, not in ſtate and condition, but in order; not in eſſence, but in forme; not in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but in kinde: for there is one and the ſame ſtate of eſſence and power, becauſe theſe three perſons bee but one God.</p>
               <p>But to leave this: The perſons of the Trinity are here diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: they are ſanctified of God the Father, and reſerved unto Ieſus Chriſt. The perſons of the Father and the Sonne are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as in all other places: <hi>Pater quaſi fons exuberans; filius ut rivus defluens; ille ut Sol, hic ut radius; ille ut os, hic ut vox proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: nonautem ſeparantur, ſicut nec rivus a fonte, nec radius a Sole, nec vox abore: quia aqua fontis eſt in Rivo, &amp; ſolis lumen in radio, &amp; oris virtus in voce:</hi> The Father, as the fountaine abounding, the Sonne, as the river flowing; he as the Sunne, this as the beame; hee as the mouth, this as the voice proceeding: they are not ſeparated, as neither the river is ſeparated from the fountaine, nor the beame from the Sunne, nor the voyce from the mouth, for the water in the fountaine is in the river, as the light of the Sunne is in the beame, and the vertue of the mouth in the voyce.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of the perſons obſcurely delivered in the Old Teſtament, in the New is made clearer than the noone-day. For at the Baptiſme of Chriſt, the Sonne was ſeene<hi>:</hi> The holy Ghoſt deſcended like a Dove.

                  <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is the firſt thing here wiſhed for, is aſcribed to God, the Creator; <hi>Peace,</hi> which is the ſecond, to Chriſt, the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.</note> Reconciler; <hi>Love,</hi> which is the third, to the holy Ghoſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.

               <p>Mercy is here taken for grace and the meere favour of God: The Apoſtle therefore in wiſhing Mercy, Peace and Love to the Saints, teacheth us, <hi>Quales eſſe debent Chriſtianorum ſalutatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nos literis noſtris &amp; epiſtolis, honorem, opulentiam, ſalutem, longam vitam amicis optamus, Iudas verò, miſericordiam, pacem, charitatem, &amp; dona coeleſtia, his tribus, Eccleſia opus eſt, aliter, actum eſſet.</hi> And firſt hee beginneth with Mercie: For inſtead of Grace uſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in ſundry of his Epiſtles, <hi>Iude</hi> heere nameth Mercy, which is all one; Mercy and Grace is that, whereby all good is conveyed to us: therefore an excellent bleſſing to bee prayed for, and this Grace and Mercy of God is fourefold:</p>

               <p>4 Eternall.</p>
               <p>The generall Grace and Mercy of God, are thoſe graces and mercies, that hee beſtoweth upon all men; Hence is it, that hee cauſeth, the Sun to ſhine upon good and bad, and his Raine to fall upon the juſt and unjuſt: For there bee ſome good things, which God giveth indifferently both to the good &amp; bad, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honour, Strength, Beautie, Health, &amp;c. And there be ſome good things, which God giveth onely to the good, and not to the wicked; as ſaving Faith, ſaving Grace, a new Heart, a right Spirit, peace of Conſcience, joy in the holy Ghoſt, eternall Life: And there are ſome evill things, whereof the good taſte as well as the bad; as Sickeneſſe, Sorrow, Weakeneſſe of body; Impriſonment, Famine, Sword, loſſe of Friends, &amp;c. And there are ſome evill things which God layeth upon the wicked, and not upon the good; as intolerable horror of conſcience, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <note place="margin">

               <p>The firſt is a preventing mercy or grace, by which the Lord preſerves his Elect from falling into groſſe evils; <hi>Fateor &amp; fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>niſi quia Deus adiuvit me paulo minus cecidiſſet in omne peccatum anima mea;</hi> I doe and will ingeniouſly confeſſe, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord had preſerved mee by grace, my ſoule had gone neere to have fallen into all ſinne.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is his forbearing mercy or grace, whereby the Lord waiteth for the converſion of a ſinner: in regard whereof, the ſame Author writeth thus; <hi>Ego peccabam, &amp; tu diſſimulas; non continebam a ſceleribus, &amp; tu à verberibus abſtinebas,</hi> I ſinned, O Lord, and thou ſeemeſt not to regard it, I contained not my ſelfe from wickedneſſe, and thou abſtaineſt from ſcourging me for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The third is an altering and changing mercy or grace, which makes a man ſetled in the reſolution of holineſſe, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was prophane, and looſe in behaviour.</p>
               <p>The fourth is an imbracing mercy or grace, whereby God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth the Convert of his favour.</p>
               <p>The fifth is a confirming mercy or grace, which ſtrengthneth and upholdeth the righteous in his goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſixth is a mercy or grace, that ſets him in hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of glory.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is a crowning mercy or grace, which is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſeiſin, and full poſſeſſion of the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus the LORD hath ſeven mercies or graces, nay ſeventy times ſeven mercies, even an innumerable multitude of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions; all which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> here wiſheth unto the Saints; by which it appeareth how great a bleſſing the Apoſtle wiſheth in wiſhing mercy. <hi>Mercy be unto you.</hi>

               <p>The Angels deſire an end of this evill world, the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted wiſh the accompliſhment of the Elect, the number full, the body of Chriſt made perfect. The Saints in earth cry, <hi>Veni</hi>

               <p>The ſecond bleſſing, which the Apoſtle prayeth for, is <hi>peace;</hi> which is taken three waies:</p>

               <p>And in all theſe ſignifications it may be taken in this place, in a godly ſenſe; if wee take it in the firſt ſenſe, it is a notable bleſſing, and to be prayed for of all men, as <hi>Iude</hi> doth here: for peace is the ornament of all places, as a Crowne of gold upon their head, the Kingdome of Chriſt is adorned by it. <hi>The Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lye with</hi>

Let us not buzze too neere the candle, with the flye Farſalla, leſt we burne: Let us not ſoare too high with the Eagle, leſt wee melt; let us not wade too deep with the Elephant, leſt we drown. Let us not bee curious in theſe things: It is enough that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetteth downe, Love to bee the cauſe of all bleſſings. So God turned <hi>Balaams</hi> curſe into a bleſſing unto Iſrael. The cauſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> affirmeth to bee Gods love (ſaying) <hi>Becauſe the Lord thy God</hi>

For they were the feweſt of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but <hi>Becauſe hee loved them. Iude</hi> here prayeth for it, as a moſt excellent bleſſing, without which all is nothing.

               <p>Yea, this love of his it is immutable and conſtant: For whom he loveth, he loveth to the end, hereupon the Apoſtle calleth God love. <hi>God is love</hi> (ſaith he) and not only love; for there are many properties and attributes in God, as Truth, Mercie, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Power, Eternitie: <hi>Novit omnia, ut veritas, tuetur ut ſalus,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, therefore the love of Atheiſts is condemned, which come from profit or from pleaſure, which love men, as the dog doth the bone; but this love proceedeth not <hi>Excorde puro,</hi> from a pure heart, therefore to be condemned.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, all carnall love is here condemned: For love in man may bee a vice aſwell as a grace, it is a vice, when it is ſet upon a wrong object, or is diſordered, and that three wayes:</p>

               <p>But let our love bee, as it ſhould bee, Chriſtian love: Let us love as brethren, and then the God of Love and Peace ſhall bee with us: and ſo much for this love, that Saint <hi>Iude</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for.</p>
               <p>But before I ſhut up this heavenly doctrine, note that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle wiſheth an increaſe of Mercy, Peace and Love; he would have theſe things to be multiplyed, <hi>Mercy, Peace, and Love be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied unto you:</hi> in that he wiſheth a multiplication of theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he ſheweth that there is no perfection of vertues in this life: for there is a double grace of God.</p>

                  <hi>I allow not that which I doe: for what I would, that doe I not; but what I hate, that doe I.</hi> Whereupon Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Impii &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt &amp; valent peccare, pii volunt ſed non valent, benè agere, quia nequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt quod deſiderant;</hi> the wicked are willing and able to ſinne, the <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> godly are willing, but not able to doe well, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

doe that which they deſire to doe. This made this holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Never perfect till wee come to Glory.</note> to pray, <hi>Domine dominetur carni anima, animae ratio, rationi gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp;c.</hi> Lord, let the Soule rule the Fleſh, Reaſon the Soule, Grace Reaſon; ſubdue me to thy will inwardly, outwardly ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my tongue more and more to ſound forth thy praiſes, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate my mind more and more to ſee thee, inlarge my heart more and more to beleeve in thee, &amp;c. For we comprehend not the Mercy, Peace, and Love of God in any meaſure; <hi>Beatitude noſtra tribus gradibus perficitur: in hac vita per ſpem &amp; fidem quotidie creſcentem; poſt hanc vitam, cum anima Dei praeſentia fruetur; poſt extremum judicium, cum anima &amp; corpore glorificabimur.</hi> Our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is perfected in three degrees; in this life by Faith and Hope increaſing and growing daily; after this life, when the Soule ſhall enjoy the preſence of God; after the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when as in Body and Soule wee ſhall be glorified; and when as wee ſhall ſing the ſongs of triumph, ſuch as none can underſtand ſave the hundred and forty foure thouſand which are <note place="margin">

               <p>Let us therefore pray for grace to increaſe in us, and ſay with <hi>Auguſtine, Si quando ſteti, per Dominum ſteti; ſi quando cecidi, per me cecidi, &amp;c.</hi> If at any time I ſtood, I ſtood by the Lord; if at any time I fell, I fell of my ſelfe: his Grace did prevent me, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me from evils paſt, preſerving me from evils preſent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending me from evils to come. But I will follow this point no further: but as <hi>Iude</hi> prayed that Mercy, Grace, and Love might be multiplied; So ſhall I pray, Mercy, Peace and Love bee unto you. Mercie from God the Father, the Father of Mercies; Peace from God the Sonne, the Prince of Peace; Love from God the holy Ghoſt, the Love of the Father and the Sonne: Mercy unto you releaſing your ſinnes; Peace unto you, quieting your conſciences; Love unto you, joyning you to God, and one unto another: Now the very God of Mercy, Peace, and Love give you Mercy, Peace and Love.

               <p>And note, that he calleth it <hi>Common ſalvation,</hi> not proper to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaak, Iacob, David, Peter, &amp;c.</hi> but common to all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, hee calleth it common ſalvation. Firſt, to admoniſh all men to lay hold of it. So ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie, lay hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> And alſo to admoniſh Miniſters to neglect no ſheep of God, not the very leaſt. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid that he was a <hi>debter both to the Grecians and Barbarians, both to the wiſe and vnwiſe,</hi> that hee was not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt, for it was the power of God to ſalvation to every one that beleeveth, to the lew firſt and alſo to the Grecian.</hi> And further he ſaith, that hee made himſelfe a <hi>ſervant</hi> unto all men, that he might winne the more, that unto the Iewes he became as <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21, 22.</note> a Iew, that hee might winne the Iewes; to them that were under the law, as though he were under the law, that hee might winne them that were under the Law; to them that were without law, as though he were without law, that he might winne them, that were without Law; to the weake he became as weake, that hee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20. 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 11.</note> might winne the weake; and became all things to all men, that by all meanes he might winne ſome: Hee taught publikely and privately, throughout every houſe, exhorting and comforting every one, as a Father doth his Children: Even ſo the Miniſter of God muſt be carefull of every ſoule, that he may bee partaker of this common ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, hee calleth it common ſalvation, becauſe it is not prepared for ſome few, as the Arke was for the Deluge; For <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 22.</note> then but a few, that is, <hi>Eight perſons were ſaved in the water:</hi> Neither becauſe it appertaineth to one nation, Kingdome or people, as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites; <hi>Salvation is of the Iewes:</hi> But the doctrine of the Goſpell is offered unto all. Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles <hi>in orbem, non in urbem; Goe into the world, preach the Goſpell</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:15606:52"/>
                  <hi>to every creature. Erunt illi teſtes uſque ad fines terrae,</hi> they were <note place="margin">As Salvation is common, ſo the Church is Catholike.</note> his witneſſes to the end of the world. With theſe places, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> refuted the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which tyed the Church to a ſmall corner of the world, <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee calleth it common Salvation, becauſe we are all ſaved by one common meanes, that is, by Chriſt; <hi>Salvation is of the Lord. Ego ſum, ego ſum, &amp; praeter me non eſt Salvator,</hi> I am, I <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.</note> am, and beſides mee there is no Saviour, no true Saviour. All other come ſhort; <hi>Vana ſalus hominum,</hi> Mans ſalvation is in vaine. And therefore the Elders, the Angels, and all Creatures give this glory to Chriſt, <hi>Salvation is of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and of the Lambe;</hi> and they all together, cry, <hi>Amen.</hi> For theſe cauſes it is called common Salvation.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe, as Salvation is called common, ſo the Church is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.</note> called common or Catholike in three reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is not tyed to any time, as the time of the Law, but it endureth ever. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not tyed to any place as to <hi>Iuda: For in Iuda was God knowne, and his name was great in Iſrael;</hi> but to the whole <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34.</note> world: For <hi>God is no accepter of perſons, but in every nation hee that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accepted.</hi> And the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit &amp; truth:</hi> As Chriſt ſaid unto the woman. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not tyed to any perſons, as to the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> but to all that beleeve: <hi>There is neither Iew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, but wee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> In theſe reſpects Salvation is called ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, or common, and ſo is the Church.</p>
               <p>It is worth your noting, that <hi>Iude</hi> ſayth, <hi>hee gave all diligence to write.</hi> For <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaketh here of neceſſity of writing. For <hi>Hoſius, Eckius, Pigheus, Andradius</hi> ſay, that Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Apoſtles to preach, not to write; and that their writings are <hi>ſubeſſe, non praeeſſe fidei noſtrae;</hi> that <hi>Scripturae ſequuntur Eccleſiam, the Scriptures follow the Church, and not the Church the Scriptures.</hi> But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, he wrote that the truth might remaine to poſterity; his words are theſe; <hi>I thinke it meete ſo long as I am in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15.</note>

I love not allegories, but it is true, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid, <note place="margin">Traditions the meanes of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting errors.</note> though not upon that occaſion. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw three Goſpells written; viz. <hi>Mathew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and approved them. S. <hi>Peter</hi> allowed of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, and commended them unto the Churches; yea, the Prophets nayled their prophecies in writing <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> to the doores of the Temple, which the Prieſts reſerved in the Sanctuarie, leſt the things ſhould runne out that they received by word of mouth. <hi>Paul</hi> at the end of his life ſaith of all the bookes of the New Teſtament, that <hi>they were able to make the man of God perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Traditions, and unwritten verities, or vanities, have beene ever the <hi>Pandora-boxes,</hi> full of poyſon; the <hi>Troiane</hi> horſe, out of which all enemies have iſſued; that curſed water of <hi>Styx,</hi> that killeth them that taſte it.

               <p>On the Contrarie, the written Word is called a <hi>Fountaine, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life,</hi> a <hi>Rocke</hi> whereupon the Church is built, the <hi>ſword of the</hi>

               <p>But as <hi>Noahs</hi> dove found no reſt, but in the Arke; ſo our conſciences find no reſt, but in the Word: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth the ſcriptures, the <hi>Lords Scales,</hi> which ſhew <hi>Quid grave, quid leve,</hi> what <note place="margin">Auguſt. contra Donat.</note> is heavie, and what is light; <hi>Vbi non appendimus, quid volumus, ſed omnia per trutinam Domini;</hi> whereby wee apprehend not what we would, but all things according to the ballance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of the Lord himſelfe: And he ſaith unto them often, <hi>Aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur de medio chartae noſtrae, procedat in medium codex Dei;</hi> take away from among us our owne writings, and let the booke of God be brought forth: <hi>Non audiamus, Haec dico, haec dicis; ſed hoc dicit Dominus;</hi> Let us not heare theſe words, This ſay I, this ſaieſt thou, but this ſaith the Lord.

Thus, as <hi>Midas</hi> had power to turne all he touched into gold, ſo theſe men have power to turne all they touch into lyes, and all under colour of traditions.

               <p>And firſt, <hi>that faith is a gift,</hi> it is evident by the Apoſtles owne words, where he calleth Chriſt, <hi>The author and finiſher of our faith;</hi> as the Athenians were called, <hi>Inventrices &amp; perfectrices omnium do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinarum,</hi> the inventers and perfecters of all good learning: The <note place="margin">

               <p>Firſt, it is taken for Fidelity, as it is a vertue in the ſecond <note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, It is taken for Chriſt himſelfe, by a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> who is both the object and cauſe of faith: So the Apoſtle uſeth the word ſaying, <hi>But after that faith is come, wee are no longer under a</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is taken for knowledge only; and thus the Divels are ſaid to beleeve.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is taken for the gift of working miracles; <hi>If I had</hi>

               <p>And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cals the <hi>faith of Gods elect;</hi> For none but the elect, have it, &amp; al the elect have it, at one time or another; and once had it can never be finally and totally loſt, but it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth with them, till they come to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living &amp; then they ſhall have no more need of it: It is therfore called <hi>Saving faith,</hi> becauſe it brings us to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8.</note> And <hi>Iuſtifying faith,</hi> becauſe it is that meanes or inſtrument which Gods ſpirit worketh in us, whereby wee apply unto our ſelves Chriſt Ieſus, in and by whom wee are iuſtified: And <hi>Sanctifying faith,</hi> becauſe by it God purifieth our hearts. This ſaving, iuſtifying, ſanctifying faith is Gods gift: for hee is the Authour of this faith; <hi>From whom every good gift, and</hi>

                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 2.</note> thing that moved God to worke this precious gift in us, is his meere good will: So ſaith our Saviour; <hi>It is ſo Father, becauſe thy good pleaſure was ſuch.</hi> And the end at which he aymed in working <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 26.</note> this grace, is, firſt, the ſetting forth of his owne glory: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſalvation of mankinde; and therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>The end of our Faith.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This doctrine ſerveth to humble us; to let us ſee, that it is not in our power, that faith is not hereditary: God beginneth it, and increaſeth it, and finiſheth it. The Apoſtles prayed, <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi>

               <p>But the eſpeciall ordinary meanes, and the moſt powerfull uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes, is the word preached.

the beginning and it hath, doth, and ſhall continue for ever. This <note place="margin">As God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, ſo true faith and Religion.</note> commendeth the Faith, the Religion of God, that it is before all religions; the ancienteſt Philoſophers, and Poets, as <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Heſiod,</hi> exceeded not the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who yet lived five hundred yeeres after <hi>Moſes</hi> the writer of the Law.</p>
               <p>Againe, all the wonderfull things recounted in the Scripture are recorded by the Heathen; as <hi>Noahs</hi> flood by <hi>Beroſus,</hi> the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> by the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> the ſtorie of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Dupolimus,</hi> the acts of <hi>Salomon</hi> recorded by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee deny the Lord Ieſus, by denying the efficacie or vertue of his Death, not dying unto ſinne: Therefore <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from Death, that Chriſt may give thee</hi>

Such are our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, the former are Papiſts, the later are Atheiſts, and both deny Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The profeſſion of Chriſt ſtandeth not in words, but in deeds, not in tongue, but in heart, not in opinion, but in life. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle nameth a true Knowledge; for many know not God true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it an <hi>Idle</hi> knowledge, diſtinguiſhing of knowledge, that it is <hi>Operans, &amp; otioſa,</hi> a working and an idle <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.</note> knowledge: for ſome carrie Chriſt in their mouth and braine, as perfume in a Pomander, without ſmell; as a ſword in a ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, without cutting; as fire in a flint, without heat. But this I will ſay to thee in the ſight of God and his Angels; that if thou doeſt not dye to ſinne and riſe againe by a new life; if thou doeſt not kill ſinne in thee, as Murder, Whoredome, Malice, covetouſneſſe, Vſury, Pride, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. thou doeſt neither beleeve the Death nor the Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. So ſaith <hi>Paul, Know yee not that all wee which have beene baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus Chriſt, have beene baptized into his Death?</hi> And againe, <hi>If wee</hi>

Theſe are the ſignes of our election, and this election is every <note place="margin">God reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in Iuſtice, as well as elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> way free: Never man layd hand on this worke, never man brought ſtone to this building, but all is from God, and his Mercy.

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.</note> Reprobation ſtandeth with the glory of God: for as his Mercy appeareth in Election, ſo his Iuſtice in Reprobation, and his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in puniſhing ſinne, is as lawfull, as holy, as glorious, as his Mercy in Chriſt Ieſus.

So God hath them that are elected to life, and fore-written to judgement<hi>:</hi> for in the whole ſtate of the world God hath ſhewed himſelfe the Authour of Iuſtice and Mercy. If there were no Darkeneſſe, wee ſhould not know the benefit of Light; If no ſickneſſe, wee ſhould not know the benefit of health; If no death, wee ſhould not know the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life.

               </p>
               <p>To proceede orderly in this point: there bee three opinions, the firſt, of the <hi>Libertines:</hi> the ſecond, of them that deny Gods <note place="margin">Aug.</note> Providence, by granting a bare permiſſion, as that he ſuffereth all things, but not that hee <hi>willeth</hi> all things: the third opinion is of them that grant God to <hi>doe</hi> all, but ſo, that all actions, as they proceed from God, are juſt, but as they are done of us, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; the <hi>Libertines</hi> make God the author of ſin, &amp; ſay of all thefts, murders, whoredomes, that not man, but God did them, they call all theſe ſinnes, mens vocations, and that doing them, we do but walke in our vocations; they ſay, <hi>Omnia licent: all things are lawfull: Ergo licet ſcortari, furari, occidere,</hi> therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> to whore, ſteale, kill; ſo reaſoned <hi>Quintinus</hi> the Libertine with <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Omnia munda mundis:</hi> all things are cleane to the <note place="margin">

Another uſeth this <hi>Simile,</hi> That as in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a bad knife, the cutting is of my ſelfe, but the evill cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is of the knife; So the action is of God, but the evill of the action is of our ſelves. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Deum per malos agere:</hi>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15606:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaying of two worthy men, <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius. Auguſtine</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Deum non ſimpliciter creare quenquam ad exitium,</hi> that God not ſimply hath created any to deſtruction, but the cauſes <note place="margin">1 <hi>Hoſca</hi> 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> of deſtruction are of himſelfe: <hi>Perditio tua ex te, O Iſrael,</hi> thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, <hi>O Iſrael;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the wicked periſh through their owne corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Deum non ſpectare reproborum exitium, ut ultimum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ſed gloriam ſuam, quae in eorum juſta condemnatione lucet,</hi> that God beholdeth not the deſtruction of the wicked, as the laſt end: but his glory, which ſhineth moſt brightly in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

So ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>Pater tradidit filium, filius corpus, Iudas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrum: In hac traditione cur Deus juſtus &amp; homo injuſtus? niſi quod in re una quam fecerunt, non eſt cauſa una ob quam fecerunt?</hi> The Father delivered the Sonne, the Son his body, <hi>Iudas</hi> his maſter; in this tradition or delivering, why is God juſt, and man unjuſt? becauſe that in that one thing, which they did, there was not one cauſe for the which they did it; <hi>Deus, in dilectione, Chriſtus, in obedientia, Iudas ab avaritia, Iudaei ob invidiam:</hi> God delivered him in love, Chriſt delivered himſelfe in obedience, <hi>Iudas</hi> of covetouſneſſe, the Iewes of envy. Thus they all did one action, but not to one end.</p>
               <p>And yet true is the ſaying of <hi>Fulgentius, Malos ad poenam, non culpam praedeſtinari:</hi> the wicked to be predeſtinate to puniſhment, not to ſinne, <hi>non ad hoc, quod malè operantur, ſed ad hoc, quod juſtè pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuntur:</hi> not to this, that they worke evilly, but to this end, that they ſuffer juſtly: For God ordaines no man to be evil, though he hath ordained the evill unto puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; for ſhould God ordaine men unto ſin, then ſhould God be the Author of ſin: he ordaines indeed the incitements and occaſions of ſin, to try men withall; he alſo orders ſins committed, and does limit them; and in theſe regards is ſaid as before to <hi>worke</hi> in them, and to <hi>will</hi> them: in which regards alſo they are in Scripture attributed unto him ſometimes, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 11, 12. and 15. 16. But yet wee muſt not ſay (as ſome do) that God is the Author of ſinne, or predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates men unto it. <hi>Sed quia Dei myſteria non capimus, corripimus:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee cannot conceive Gods myſteries, wee will cavell and carpe at them. <hi>Nunquid negandum quod verum eſt, quia comprehendi non poteſt, quod occultum eſt?</hi> Is that to be damned which is true, becauſe it cannot be comprehended, for that it is ſecret? Eate hony, but not too much hony: ſo ſearch Gods myſteries, but not too far.

Alſo in Horeb yee provoked the Lord to anger, ſo that the Lord was wroth with you to deſtroy you. Alſo in Taberah, and in Maſſah, and in Kibroth-hattaavah yee provoked the Lord to anger; likewiſe when the Lord ſent you from Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſhbarnea, ſaying, Goe up and poſſeſſe the Land, that I have given you, then yee rebelled againſt the Commandement of the Lord your God, and beleeved him not, nor harkened to his voyce: yee have beene rebellious ever ſince I knew you:</hi> you were never good, egge nor bird, firſt nor laſt.

               <p>Now this faith is Gods gift, and cannot be commanded. For though Chriſt had done many miracles, and preached many heavenly Sermons unto the Iewes: yet they beleeved not, <hi>That the ſaying of Eſayas the Prophet might be fulfilled, that hee ſaid, Lord,</hi>

               <p>Moſt men beleeve not; For our faith hath a triple foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Firſt, that Chriſt is true God, and therefore can help; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p>Hence commeth all miſchiefe, that wee beleeve not God, which appeareth in our life. If a ſicke man ſhould have two Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, the one preſcribing a preſent remedy, the other a preſent poiſon, if he ſhould follow the latter, would wee not conclude, that either he would not be healed, or elſe that hee beleeved not the other: ſo ſtandeth the caſe betwixt God and us, either wee would not bee ſaved, or elſe wee doe not beleeve God.</p>
               <p>This is manifeſt in two men, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> the one the father of all men, the other of the faithfull: Now <hi>Adam</hi> eate of <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> when God commanded him to offer his Sonne, he did it. For he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.</note> beleeved God, and ſo doe few men. But let us not liſten to Satan and our owne fleſh, but to God, promiſing happineſſe, if we obey him.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt here two counſellors, the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> The fleſh bids thee follow thy luſtes, but the ſpirit ſaith, if thou doeſt ſo, thou ſhalt periſh: <hi>For he that ſoweth in the fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption, but hee that ſoweth in the ſpirit ſhall of the ſpirit</hi>

Even a deſire of Faith is a token of faith: For Gods ſpirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">God giues grace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of Faith.</note> that; but no faith is accurſed: <hi>For he that beleeveth not is còn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> There be degrees in faith, three examples we have: The firſt of the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the Synagogue, who beleeved that his daughter ſhould revive, if Chriſt would but touch her.

               <p>Faith is <hi>Illuminatio mentis,</hi> the light of the minde: Infidells are blind, and ſhall not ſee heaven; they are <hi>filii irae,</hi> children of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk</hi> 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> wrath, and they that beleeve not cannot be ſaved. <hi>Faith</hi> is Gods gate, whereby God enters into our ſoule; the light that found the loſt groate; the purifier of our heart; the conqueror in the race; the pole-ſtarre for the ſayler; the life of the ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by Faith Chriſt dwells in our hearts. O help us Lord, wee beleeve, ô help our unbeleefe; he muſt beleeve that comes to God: and as is our faith, ſo is our bleſſing; faith is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world.

               <p>The ſecond example uſed for Confirmation of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propoſition; That we muſt ſtrive for faith: is taken from Gods vengeance upon the <hi>Angels,</hi> who becauſe they <hi>kept not their eſtate, but left their habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chaines of darkeneſse, to the Iudgement of the great day.</hi> So that here in theſe <hi>Angels,</hi> Obſerve;</p>

               <p>Thy ſinne of theſe Angels I will not preciſely diſcuſſe; their ſinne, (like <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne) was not alone, but many.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there was <hi>pride</hi> in them, as it appeareth by <hi>Pauls</hi> words to <hi>Timothie;</hi> where handling the office of a Miniſter, among other <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</note> things, he would not have him to bee a young ſcholler, <hi>Leſt hee being puffed up, fall into the condemnation of the Divell;</hi> that is, leſt being proud of his degree, hee bee likewiſe condemned as the

               </p>
               <p>But beſides pride, there were many other ſinnes in them, as <hi>Infidelity, Ingratitude, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion; Denique, quid non?</hi> to conclude, what not? not one vice, but many, even a troope, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of ſinnes: For ſinnes are like Piſmires in a moll-hill, like Bees in an hive, like Motes in the Sunne, there are many ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not one ſinne alone, they grow like cluſters of grapes: ſinne is like the linke of a chaine, take hold of one linke, and draw the whole chaine: ſo take hold of one ſinne, and draw a number.</p>

               <p>But to proceed; my meaning is not, that all Apoſtacy is ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: for every Apoſtacy is not uncurable, every fall of man is not damnable, as the fall of Angels; yet it is dangerous: <hi>for he that ſettetb his hand to the plough, and looketh back,</hi>

An euill ſpirit vexed <hi>Saul:</hi> but it is added, <hi>That God ſent him.</hi> An evill ſpirit deceived <hi>Ahab:</hi> but it is added, that <hi>God put him into the mouths of the Prophets:</hi> Satan <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.</note> could not touch <hi>Iob</hi> but as God permitted him: <hi>Moſes</hi> was a figure of Chriſt, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of the Divell, now as <hi>Pharoah</hi> could not hold Iſrael in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> So Satan cannot hold us in bondage longer than God will.

                  <hi>in everlaſting chaines.</hi> As in my text: For the Lord dealeth with Divels, as men uſe to do with curſt bandogs, which will flie at the throate of every one, whom they met; they tye &amp; chain them up <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.</note> for feare of doing hurt: For proofe whereof note what God ſaid to the Divel under the ſerpent, <hi>Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> By which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</note> phraſe is implied a reſtraint, namely that hee ſhould not come ſo high as the Saints head, to cruſh it, he ſhould onely ſnarle at the heele, and bite it: that is, he ſhould not be able utterly to deſtroy their ſoules.</p>
               <p>I but Satan is now loſed, and the thouſand yeares, wherein hee <note place="margin">

               <p>But brethren, ye ſhal underſtand, that this is ſpoken <hi>Comparativè,</hi> comparatively, in regard of former reſtraint, as when a dogge hath beene ſomtime tyed up very cloſe, and afterward his chaine is let further, he may be ſaid to be looſed.</p>
               <p>But the Lord limiteth this his libertie, he can goe no further, than God will give him leave. For if it were not limited, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell ſhould ſoone <hi>devoure</hi> all mankind, if hee were not reſtrained no creature could reſiſt him, and ſtand before him: As the Sea, if it <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</note> had not bounds, would ſoone overwhelme the whole world. So would the Divel ſoone turne all topſi-turvy, &amp; bring all to the very depth of Hell, where he himſelfe is. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Note theſe two Aphoriſmes; that the joyes of the elect and bleſſed Angels ſhal be greater; and that the torment of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and the damned ſhal be heavier, than their double puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be more grievous, than ever it was: that is <hi>poena damni, &amp; poena ſenſus</hi> their paine of loſſe, and paine of ſenſe.

               <p>The captivitie of Hell is like the captivitie of Iſrael in <hi>Aſsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi> that is, irreturnable: the joyes of the elect ſhal be ſo great as no tongue can utter them: and the paines of the damned ſhal be ſo extreme, as no eare can heare them, no heart conceive them.

pangs. For theſe evill Angels, with all the wicked, ſhall have <note place="margin">The wicked ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in hell in thoſe parts they ſinned.</note> puniſhment without pity, miſerie without mercie, ſorow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour, crying without comfort, miſchief without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, torment without eaſe; <hi>Where the worme dieth not, and the fire is never quenched;</hi> Where the wrath of God ſhall ſeaze upon body and ſoule, as the flame of fire doth on pitch and brimſtone. Oh who can expreſſe the paines of fire and brimſtone, ſtinch and darkneſſe? Without hope of releaſe and comfort. Men and Angels cannot doe it, if that they ſhould ſummon a Parliament together, for the ſame end and purpoſe. For as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid of the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 2.</note> elect, <hi>It doth not appeare what we ſhal be,</hi> ſo ſay I of theſe evill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and of all the rable of the reprobats, it doth not appeare what they ſhal be. <hi>Iudas, Herod, Pilate</hi> have been many hundred yeares in fire already, but yet the greateſt is to come.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall thy laſcivious eyes be afflicted with the ſight of ghaſtly ſpirits; thy curious eares affrighted with the hideous howling of damned Divels and reprobates; thy dainty noſe, ſhal be cloyed with noyſome ſtinch of Sulphur; thy delicate taſt, pained with intollerable hunger; thy drunken throate ſhal be parched with intollerable thirſt; thy mind tormented to thinke, how fooliſh thou wert for earthly pleaſures, to loſe heavens joyes and incurre helliſh paynes: thy conſcience ſhall ever ſting thee like an Adder and thou ſhalt weepe more teares, than there is water in the Sea. For the water of the ſea is finite, but the weeping of a reprobate ſhall be infinite.</p>
               <p>If any man will aske, how it can ſtand with Gods juſtice to puniſh a finite ſinne, with an infinite puniſhment. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>

                     <hi>Greg: lib</hi> 4. <hi>Moral. cap</hi> 12.</note> anſwereth two manner of wayes: Firſt, he ſaith <hi>Corda non facta penſat deus,</hi> God pondereth our hearts not our deeds: <hi>peccant cum fine qui vivunt cum fine,</hi> their ſinne hath an end becauſe their life hath an end; but if they could have lived without end, they would have ſinned without end. <hi>Aequum ergo eſt, ut nunquam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat ſupplicio, qui nunquam voluit carere peccato, ut nullus daretur illi terminus ultioni, qui noluit ponere terminum crimini:</hi> It is right and juſt that he ſhould never want puniſhment, which never would want ſinne; that no end ſhould be given to him of revenge, which would make no end of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he anſwereth thus; <hi>Quantò major eſt perſona eò major eſt injuria in illum commiſſa.</hi> The greater the perſon is, ſo much the greater is the treſpaſſe and injurie done unto him. An injurie, a treſpaſſe done to a meane man, a common perſon: that perſon can bring but his action upon the caſe againſt him, but a treſpas done againſt a noble man, is <hi>ſcandalum magnatum;</hi> againſt thy prince and Sovereigne, it is death: for it is <hi>Crimen leſae Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis.</hi> Seing then God is infinite the puniſhment of the treſpaſſe done againſt him muſt be infinite alſo.</p>

And further he ſaith, that the aſhes of Iuniper being raked up in the coles of Iuniper keepe fire all the yeere an end. And againe (ſaith he) Take me a Peacocke, and dreſſe it, and it will not putrifie, but abide ſweet all the yeere an end. Take me ſnow and wrap it up in chaffe, and it preſerves it; but take fruit and lay them in chaffe, it melloweth and rotteth them: Take unſlaked lyme, and bring it into the Sunne, it is cold: and throw it into the water, and it burneth: The adamant is not broken, but with the blood of a goat, and who can give a reaſon of this? <hi>Apud Garamantas</hi> there is a fountain ſo cold in the day, that a man cannot drink of the water thereof, and ſo hot in the night, that a man cannot touch it for ſcalding. There is a fountaine in <hi>Epirus</hi> if ye bring torches that burne unto it, it puts them out, but if ye bring torches that be out, it kindleth them. There is a ſtone in <hi>Arcadia</hi> called <hi>Asbestos,</hi> which being once kindled, can never be quenched. And there is a ſtone in <hi>Thracia,</hi> that burneth in the water, but put out with oyle. The horſes of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> conceive with the wind. Thus God dealeth ſtrangely with his creatures, why not with the fire of hell, theſe evill Angels, and all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beſides, <hi>Semper comburentur, nunquam conſumentur,</hi> they ſhall alwayes be burning but never conſumed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is demanded, how the evill Angels and mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">

               <p>Laſtly, note; that the day wherein the Angels ſhall be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is called a <hi>great day; He hath reſerved in everlaſting chaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkeneſſe, unto the iudgement of the great day.</hi> It is called a <hi>great day,</hi> and it is ſo called in three reſpects; <hi>Great</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> who is thus deſcribed by <hi>Daniel; I beheld till the thrones were</hi>

                  <hi>his wife, and every woman her husband;</hi> one man, one wife. Into <hi>Noabs</hi> Arke there entred <hi>Noah</hi> and his wife, his ſonnes, and their wives, and of beaſts both cleane and uncleane, the male and the female.

               <p>The ſecond, <hi>Ne quod alterius est, invito eripiatur;</hi> let nothing which belongs to another man, bee taken from him againſt his will: How then can the man, without offering manifeſt wrong unto his Wife, beſtow his body upon another woman. Thus by the Law of God and Nature; Poligamie is condemned.</p>
               <p>I, but how came it to paſſe, that the Fathers had many wives? It is anſwered diverſly: Firſt, this came to paſſe by Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; for God according to the ſtate of thoſe times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with the Patriarks for the Law, which hee made in the beginning, and this is evident by the examples of <hi>Abraham, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and <hi>Elc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nah,</hi> and other godly Fathers, who were not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any Prophet, for their multiplicity of wives: Nay, which is more, <hi>God gave Sauls wives</hi> (as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaith) <hi>into the boſome of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>David.</hi> Now if God gave <hi>David</hi> wives, notwithſtanding his firſt inſtitution to the contrary, we may conclude, that hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with his owne law, and gave the Patriarchs liberty for Polygamie.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this diſpenſation, was this: God in thoſe times had choſen the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his people, in whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the true worſhip of the Deity was preſerved; for all other people were given to idolatry, and went a whoring after ſtrange Gods. Now to that intent, that that people, whom God had choſen, namely <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might be many in number, Poligamie was permitted.</p>
               <p>Againe, though the Fathers had many wives, yet they were not hereunto led by luſt, but by a chaſt deſire to augment and multiply Gods family.</p>
               <p>From this Polygamie of the Fathers, ſome have concluded that Polygamie is lawfull unto us; let ſuch Opinioniſts know, that <hi>a generall canon cannot bee infringed by a particular example.</hi> If we can claime the ſame diſpenſation the Patriarchs had, then I grant a man may have many wives; for now there is no Nation more peculiarly Gods people than another; <hi>But in every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                     <hi>Aug. lib. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu &amp; anima cap.</hi> 56.</note> wretches, there ſhall be a death without death, an end without end, a decay without decay, becauſe their death ſhall ever live, and their end ſhall ever begin, and their decay knoweth not how to decay; death ſhall preſſe them, but not extinguiſh them; ſorrow ſhall torment them, and not drive away their feare; the fire ſhall burne them, and not conſume them, nor yet diſpell their darkeneſſe; for in this fire is obſcuritie, darkeneſſe, and in this obſcurity and darkeneſſe, feare and trembling; and in this combuſtion and burning, ſorrow: they ſhall alwaies ſuffer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alwayes ſhall feare, becauſe they ſhall be tormented
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15606:109"/>
without hope of pardon. If after ſo many thouſand yeeres, as <note place="margin">Eternity of torments in hell aggravate miſery.</note> they have haires on their heads, they might have an end of their torment, there were ſome hope, and they might indure thoſe torments more quietly, but becauſe they have no hope, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their paines ſhall be either eaſed or ended, <hi>deſperatione defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,</hi> they faile, they faint, and quaile thorow deſpaire; <hi>Et ad tormenta non ſufficiunt,</hi> and they are no way able to indure thoſe torments. <hi>Ibi erit tortor ſemper caedens,</hi> there ſhall be a tormentor ever beating them; <hi>Et vermis ſemper corrodens,</hi> and a worme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gnawing them; <hi>Etignis ſemper comburens,</hi> a fire alwayes burning them; For <hi>their worme ſhall not dye, neither ſhall their fire be quenched,</hi> ſinnes ſhall bee detected, and the ſinnes ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66. 24.</note> and that for ever, they ſhall ſee divels, but not God; <hi>Quod eſt omnium meſeriarum miſerrimum,</hi> which of all miſeries is moſt miſerable. For if <hi>Abſalom</hi> tooke it ſo grievouſly, that hee <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32.</note> was baniſhed his Fathers preſence, and could not ſee his face? how grievouſly ſhall the Reprobate be afflicted, to be baniſhed Gods preſence, and not to ſee his face? for they ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with eternall perdition, from the preſence of God, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9.</note> of his power.</p>
               <p>But to follow this point a little further; all men in miſery comfort themſelves with hope of an end; the priſoner with hope of a gaole-delivery, the mariner with hope of arrivall, the ſouldier with hope of victory, the prentiſe with hope of liberty the gally-ſlave with hope of ranſome; onely the poore caitiffe in hell hath no hope; he ſhall have end without end, death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death, night without day, morning without mirth, ſorrow without ſolace, bondage without liberty.</p>
               <p>Let fire and eternall fire move us; common fire is quenched with water, wilde fire with milke and vinegar, but hell fire is not quenched, <hi>their worme dyeth not, and the fire never goeth out.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 44.</note> why ſhould not wee beleeve this? ſeeing that their is a certaine ſtone in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> called <hi>Asbeſtos,</hi> which being once kindled, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goeth out, never can be quenched. If this be in a ſtone, how much more in the power of God? This earthly fire, except it be nouriſhed with wood and other combuſtible matter will out but the fire of hell never goeth out, it alwaies burneth and never ceaſeth. The reaſon is becauſe our fire is not, <hi>In loco proprio,</hi> in his proper place, <hi>ſed violenta,</hi> but in a violent. The fire of hell is in his proper place, for the breath of the Lord kindleth it. We <note place="margin">Greg in morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

If this may be by the power of nature, why may not that by the power of God. The paines of hell be ſuch, that all the Arithmetitians in the world,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15606:110"/>
cannot number them, nor all the Geometritians meaſure them, <note place="margin">The terrours of hell ſhould deterre from ſinne.</note> nor all the Rhetoritians expreſſe them, <hi>Quid hora ad diem,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith one, what is an houre to a day, a day to a month, a month to a yeere, a yeere to a thouſand yeeres, and a thouſand yeeres to eternity. <hi>Mathuſelah</hi> lived almoſt a thouſand yeeres, but the yeeres that are paſt, are nothing, we have nothing of time, but that which is preſent. The Pigmaeans lived onely ſeven yeeres, never reached unto eight yeeres: And their be certaine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bred and borne at the river <hi>Hiſpanis,</hi> that live but a day, in the morning they are bred and brought forth, at noone they are at their full ſtrength, at night they make their end, and are gone: compare our yeeres with eternity, and wee are in the ſame ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this endleſſe puniſhment is the infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God, words againſt common perſons beare but common actions, againſt noble men they be <hi>Scandala magnatum;</hi> againſt Princes, they be treaſon; ſo the perſon of God aggravateth the ſinne. If any aske then how Chriſts death could ſatisfie the juſtice of God, ſeeing it was not eternall. I anſwer, that he did it thorow the excellency of his Perſon, and the perfection of his merits.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of theſe paines in hell, will drive away the remembrance of ſinne, as the Adamant is contrary to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and ſuffereth it to draw no iron to it; behold the weight of hell paines in Chriſt: How ſweat he? how cryed he, <hi>Deus meus, deus meus, quare dereliquisti me? My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> How did teares of blood trickle from him? If hell paines were ſo grievous unto him? what will they be to us? Onely this difference is betwixt Chriſt and us, that hee ſuſtained all mens ſinnes, wee but our owne ſinnes, our paine therefore not ſo great as his; but yet of greater and longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, his was but temporall, ours eternall, if we repent not, <hi>We muſt ſuffer the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remembrance of fire, and eternall fire, ſwalloweth up all our cogitations: <hi>How can our hearts endure, or how can our hands be ſtrong in that day, When the Lord ſhall have to doe with us,</hi> the earth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 14.</note> ſhall tremble before him, <hi>All faces ſhall gather blackeneſſe, the earth ſhall tremble before him, the heavens ſhall ſhake, the Sun and the Moone</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall be darkned, and the ſtarres ſhall withdraw their ſhining.</hi> If a Barne were full of Corne, having tenne thouſand quarters of wheate in it, and a bird ſhould every yeere carry away one kirnel in her neb, it would have an end at laſt: If a Mountaine were twenty miles high, and but one ſhovell full of earth in a yeere taken from it, in time it would deminiſh, and come to nothing: but hell deminiſheth not, there is no end of it. When the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked have beene frying in hell ſo many hundred yeeres as there be piles of graſſe growing upon the face of the earth, nay, ſo

many thouſand yeeres, as there be ſands, or drops of water in <note place="margin">God uſually proportions puniſhment to ſinne.</note> the Sea, nay ſo many million of yeeres, as there be creatures in heaven and in earth; yet are they as farre from being delivered out of the captivity of hell, as they were the firſt day of their entrance. I ſay therefore of Gods judgements, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of Gods wiſedome; <hi>O alitudo; O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God!</hi> O the depth of the juſtice and judgements of God, how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out. Now the very Papiſts make foure places of torment: 1. <hi>Infernum,</hi> Hell: 2. <hi>Purgatorium,</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: 3. <hi>Limbum puerorum non baptizatorum,</hi> A place where were children that dye without baptiſme; and 4. <hi>Limbum patrum,</hi> A place where the Fathers were. Now ſaw they, Chriſt never deſcended into Hell, to deliver any from thence, but he brought the Fathers, <hi>E limbo patrum,</hi> in his paſſion; for in hell there is no redemption. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>By the way note, that as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> burned in the fire of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane luſt; ſo God burned them with the fire of his vengeance. <hi>Poena ſaepe peccato reſpondet,</hi> the puniſhment is oftentrmes anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the ſinne committed, and done; God puniſheth men <note place="margin">Aug.</note> according to the quality of their ſinnes. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> adored <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.</note> Mice and rattes, ſo they were plagued with mice and rattes. And as they drew the arke out of his boundes: ſo God drew their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trales out of their courſe: And as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> overthrew Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in one Altar erected at Ieruſalem; So God overthrew his <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.</note> Altar at Bethel. And as he reſtrayned the hands of Iſrael to offer to the true God, but to his golden Calves; ſo his hand dried up. God puniſheth drunkards with dropſies, and then, <hi>Woe to the Crowne of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim.</hi> And he puniſheth the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28. 1.</note> covetous men with theeves, who ſpoiſe them, as they have ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 30.</note> And he puniſheth the adulterers with pox and ſuch like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. For the Adulterer many tymes carieth a body to the grave full of maladies and a ſoule to hell, to eternall fire full of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and he puniſheth Tyrants by men as bloody as themſelves, and thus he puniſhed <hi>Adonizedeck,</hi> For he had cut off the fingers and toes of many kings, at laſt his owne fingers and toes were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1.</note> cut off: For <hi>With what meaſure we mete to others the ſame ſhall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to us againe.</hi> The howſe of <hi>valois</hi> having druncke blood voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded blood, and of Engliſh perſecuters died many ſtrangely: oh then let us take heed, how we offend; For God will come in judgement he will be a ſwift witneſſe, and a ſharpe Iudge againſt vs, as here againſt the Sodomites; who were not only deſtroied with fire and brimſtone from Heaven temporally, but alſo <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this example of Gods vengeance, is ſo famous that it is recorded by moſt writers both prophane and divine. Among prophane, <hi>Solinus, Cornelius Tacitus, Strabo, Stephanus, Pliny, Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:15606:111"/>
have written of it. Among divine, <hi>Moſes, Deut</hi> 29. and <hi>Eſay</hi> cap 1. <note place="margin">Sodome not puniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but thoſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke with her.</note> and 13. <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo cap. 23. and 44. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in like manner wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of it as it appeareth cap. 16. <hi>Amos</hi> in his fourth chapter. <hi>Sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hany,</hi> in his ſecond chapter; and the Lord Ieſus in the 16. of <hi>Mathew</hi> mentioneth it; and ſo alſo doth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9. and S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle and ſecond chapter; and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 11. of the <hi>Apocalips.</hi> Let us therfore make profit and <hi>Clenſe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And further obſerve with me that not only <hi>Sodome</hi> was deſtroied, and ſuffered the vengeance of eternall fire; but many Cities beſides. <hi>Moſes.</hi> Deut. 29. and the Prophet <hi>Hoſea.</hi> cap 11. beſides Sodome nameth 3. Citties more: <hi>Gomorra, Zeboim, Admah:</hi> and unto theſe ſome other writers ad <hi>Phagor:</hi> ſo that five Cities ſuffred the vengeance of eternall fire. <hi>Egeſippus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> ſay that 10. Cities were deſtroied: and ſome ſay 13. <hi>Ioſephus, Tertullian Auguſtine</hi> and others write, that the aire there is ſo infectious, that if a bird flieth over it, it dieth preſently; and that no creature can live there, and the apples, and other fruite that grow there howſoever they ſeeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto the eye, yet if you do but touch them, they fall to Cinder and aſhes. The ſumme of all is to admoniſh us not to follow ſtrang fleſh, as they did. <hi>But to keep our veſſels in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and not in the lust of concupiſcence.</hi> As <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomor.</hi>

Heaven will not receive them. O that men could-ſee into Hell, they ſhould ſee as many defilers of the fleſh, as many whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as of any ſin againſt the ſecond table!</p>
               <p>Many make little reckoning of this ſin of whoredome, which the Apoſtle meaneth <hi>by defiling of the fleſh:</hi> but if the puniſhment provided for it, already ſpoken of, cannot let you ſee the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe of this ſinne, then liſten to that, which now I ſhall ſay unto you: Firſt, it taketh away the heart of a man: ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Whoredome and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</hi> As <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> had the heart of a beaſt; ſo theſe defilers of the fleſh have beaſtly hearts. <hi>Et praeſtat beſtiam eſſe, quàm beſtialiter</hi>

                  <hi>vivere,</hi> A man had better be a beaſt, than live beaſtly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſinne is ſo much the greater, becauſe it hath a lawfull remedy. <hi>To avoid fornication,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let every</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>man have his wife, and every wife her husband.</hi> And againe, <hi>They that cannot abſtaine, let them marry.</hi> A poore theefe is pittied, that ſtealeth to ſatisfie hunger, but he that ſtealeth, and hath enough of his owne, his ſinne is the greater, and the more to be puniſhed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 33.</note> ſo hee that hath a lawfull remedy, and ſuch a remedy as God hath ordained, and yet runnes a whoring, his ſinne is the more abominable, and deſerveth greater puniſhment. Such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſinne, hee had many wives and concubines, and yet hee <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> tooke another mans Wife; and therefore his ſinne was horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this ſinne of whoredome, Satan gaineth two ſoules at once; a theefe may ſteale alone, the drunkard may be drunken alone, the murtherer, blaſphemer, idolater, uſurer, &amp;c. may ſinne alone, but the whoremonger killeth two ſoules at one clap. If the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cryed for vengeance, how much more ſhall thoſe ſoules cry for vengeance, whom theſe defilers of the fleſh have brought to deſtruction: yet theſe defilers care not how many they abuſe, and whores and harlots care not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they lead to the divell, <hi>they open their quiver against every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>

                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 26. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Defilers of the fleſh, whoremongers are the Divels factors; Satan is a tempter; ſo are they, and therefore when they goe about to defile any, they ſhould anſwere them as Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee counſelled him to ſave himſelfe, <hi>Come behind mee Satan, thou art an offence unto mee.</hi> I reade of a certaine Matron <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23.</note> that being intiſed by a deſire of the fleſh, an incontinent perſon, to incontinency, ſhee denied, but not relinquiſhing his ſuit at laſt ſhee calleth for a panne of coales, and deſireth him for her ſake, to hold his hand in that panne of coales one houre? hee anſwered it was an unreaſonable requeſt. She replied, Is my requeſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to have you hold your hand in this panne of coales one
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15606:116"/>
houre? how vnreaſonable is yours? which would have have mee <note place="margin">Why our Luſts are by Saint Paul called members.</note> to yeeld to that which will burne body and ſoule in Hell flames for ever. And ſo ſhe ſent him away packing, and ſo muſt all chaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies anſwere theſe defilers.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, this ſinne of whoredome is an abominable ſinne, becauſe God forbids it, and all good men abhorre <hi>it. Ioſeph</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rather to indanger his life, than to defile himſelfe with his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miſtriſſe; <hi>Suſanna,</hi> before ſhee would ſuffer the filthy Iudges <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 12.</note> to defile her, adventured her bodie to the fire, and burned had ſhe beene, had not God delivered her: but in this ſinnefull age many will adventure their lives to doe it, and are ſo farre from <hi>Ioſephs,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 13. 45.</note> and <hi>Suſannaes</hi> affection, from flying filthineſſe, that like <hi>Reuben</hi> they cannot reſt day nor night till they be of the number of theſe defilers of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Anger and luſt are ſo ſuch raging affections in man, that they can hardly be reſiſted: but be they as deere unto us, as our hands and our eyes, yet they muſt be plucked out and cut off. <hi>Paul</hi> compareth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 8, 9.</note> luſt unto a <hi>member:</hi> firſt, becauſe actuall ſinnes, in relation to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, are ſo many members, as grow from. Secondly, by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie</hi> of the ſubjects, luſt may bee called a member, becauſe it is brought to action, by the helpe and ſervice of the members. And thirdly, becauſe many men delight, and take pleaſure in their turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and filthineſſe, as in their members. But howſoever it bee a member, yet it muſt bee mortified; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Mortifie</hi>

                  <hi>the Lord buried him:</hi> and therefore to bury the dead is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible worke, it is a worke fit for Gods Miniſter.

               <p>Againe, if the Divell would have had <hi>Moſes</hi> body, to beguile the people, the which he could not have, then no doubt, that which hee can have, hee will not omit; that is, to take upon him <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhape, or the ſhape of a Saint, or an Angell to beguile us withall.

But I will ſay to them, as one ſaid, <hi>Hoc genus hominum ridere ſoleo, non odiſſe:</hi> I am wont to laugh at theſe kind of men, not to hate them: they thinke much to be touched in doctrine, but I will anſwere them, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Longolius; deponant gladios, nos ſcuta abiiciemus; removeant vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, nos antidoto uti ceſſabimus ceſsent maledicere, nos non regeremus; in hoc illis conſentire non poſſumus, ut pareamus ſchiſmaticis:</hi> Let them lay away their ſwords, and wee will throw away our ſhields, Let them remove their poyſon and wee will ceaſe to uſe any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote; Let them refraine from evill ſpeaking, and we will not taunt againe: In this wee cannot conſent unto them in their ſchiſmes. I but ſay they, wee are willed, <hi>To come out from Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> yea, and <hi>To ſeparate our ſelves, and to touch no uncleane thing.</hi> I <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14.</note> confeſſe, Schiſmatikes interpret this diſceſſion locally, but the Fathers underſtand it mentally and morally. The Prophets and Apoſtles proclaimed. <hi>Touch no uncleane thing,</hi> but how? <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactu cordis, non corporis.</hi> Doth hee that commit ſinne, diſpleaſe thee? thou toucheſt no uncleane thing. Haſt thou charitably rebuked him? thou art come out from him: yet they cry out we have no Miniſters, no Sacraments, no Church at all. What is their reaſon? our lives are not anſwerable to the doctrine of the Goſpell. Be it ſo, yet this is no reaſon, why they ſhould make diſceſſion from us. How corrupt was Ieruſalem? ſo corrupt that <hi>Eſay</hi> compareth her to Sodome and Gomorah, yet hee ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">

                  <hi>touch any uncleane thing,</hi> yet he leaves them not, but goeth unto them, reproveth them, and maketh interceſſion to God for them. How deſperate was the impiety of the Phariſees in the dayes of our Saviour? Yet for all that, Chriſt our Saviour frequented their Temple, and would not forbeare their religious exerciſes. The Church of Corinth was defiled with many ſinnes, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible out-rages, both in life and Doctrine, they were deriders, ſectaries, inceſtuous, prophaners of the Lords ſupper, denyers of the moſt eſſentiall Article of the Reſurrection; yet ſo long as the Miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments was not utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth them a glorious Church. Certainely tares and uncleane veſſels are in the Church, yet let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our ſelves to be good corne, and not goe out of the Churh, but follow the counſell of <hi>Augustine, Corripiat homo, quod poteſt, quod non poteſt, patienter ferat,</hi> let a man reprove what he can (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of Schiſme) and what he cannot, let him patiently ſuffer, but let him never make ſeparation. For firſt, in the Church, there be many more that feare God, and worke righteouſneſſe, than the outward eye can diſcerne; this deceived <hi>Elias,</hi> but <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth firme, God knoweth who are his.</hi> Secondly, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</note> even of them that are vile and naught, ſome of them are touched with griefe of conſcience for their ſinnes, and hunger and thriſt after righteouſneſſe. Thirdly, a man is not to be condemned for ſome particular fact; for the brighteſt fire hath ſome ſmoke, the cleareſt water ſome mud, the face of <hi>Venus</hi> a Molle; and the moſt heavenly affection, ſome infection of earth; <hi>In multis peccavimus</hi>

                  <hi>omnes;</hi> In many things we offend all. But I may fitly apply that to our Browniſts and Separatiſts, which the religious Emperour ſaid to one of that humour, <hi>Si tam ſanctus ſis,</hi> &amp;c. If you bee ſo holy, that you will not communicate in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with us, your even fellow Chriſtians ſet a ladder to the clouds, and clime up to heaven alone. In this point the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts were ridiculous, who meeting in an aſſembly with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes for the allaying of ſome controverſies, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by the Tribune to ſit downe with the reſt; anſwered, they ſtood of purpoſe, becauſe it is written; <hi>Cum ſceleratis non ſedebo,</hi> I will not ſit downe with the wicked. To whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wittily and effectually replyed; <hi>Cur ergo ad nos intrare vobis non fuit religio, &amp;c.</hi> why then make you no conſcience to enter the ſame place with us; ſeeing it is written alſo in the precedent words, <hi>Ad mulignos non ingrediar,</hi> I will not goe unto the wicked, and with the ungodly I will not ſit downe. But let the Browniſts and all of the Separation leave their evill ſpeaking; let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to their mother the Church of England, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the governement</hi>

               <p>An evill ſpeaker is a murtherer; <hi>Et gladium portat in lingua non in vagina,</hi> and the ſword that murthereth with all, he carryeth in his tongue, not in his ſcabbard. A man may ſay to theſe evill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Pone gladium in vagina,</hi> put up thy ſword into thy ſheath. Theſe are like Cockes fed with garlicke that overcome others with rankneſſe of breath, not with ſtrength of body; <hi>Vincunt clamore, non veritate,</hi> they overcome with cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and out-cryes, not with verity and truth.

And if the wrath of God is wont to fall on the children of unbeleefe, it muſt needs fall upon theſe evill ſpeakers, for they are altogether wrapped in unbeleefe.

               <p>And note here, that no private revenge, no ſiniſter affection carried him to this execration; but being moved by the Spirit of God, he was inforced to lay the Axe of Gods vengeance to the rootes of their trees, and to cry, <hi>Woe be unto them.</hi> The Prophets and Apoſtles, in their owne cauſes, are like doves, <hi>Sine felle,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gall or bitterneſſe; but in Gods cauſe they rowſe themſelves like Giants: <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed for <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Myriam,</hi> the cauſe was his; <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed for his perſecutors, the cauſe was his; but when he commeth to handle the cauſe of God, he calleth them <note place="margin">

                  <hi>judgment in the gate:</hi> but we have inverted that order, and good men are in moſt deteſtation with us. As there is no Sunne beame without motes, no Tree without barke, no garment without mothes, no fruit without Catterpillers; ſo no vertue, no honour without envy. Theres no <hi>Iacob,</hi> whom <hi>Eſau</hi> will not perfecute; no <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> will not maligne; no <hi>Iſaak,</hi> whom <hi>Iſmael</hi>

For this cauſe one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth envy to certaine Flies, called <hi>Cantharides;</hi> for as they light ſpecially upon the faireſt wheat, and moſt blowne Roſes; ſo envy commonly oppoſeth herſelfe againſt the beſt men; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia virtutis Comes,</hi> envy is the companion of vertue. One re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth envy unto fire, for as fire coveteth the higheſt places; ſo envy aimeth at the worthieſt men. As for example, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> when he had conquered the navy of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which in number was moſt infinite, through envy was forced to leave his Country, and to live in miſerable baniſhment. <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> which for his vertues was called <hi>the juſt,</hi> yet through envy, as an unprofitable member, was cut from the body of his Country. This envy is compared, in ſome reſpect, by ſome learned men, unto the Sunne: for as the nature of the Sunne is to obſcure and darken things, which be cleare and manifeſt, and likewiſe to lighten, and to illuſtrate that which is obſcure: ſo envy endeavoureth to obſcure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe which are famous, and in the gifts and graces of the ſpirit excell others: for none are more ſubject to envy than thoſe which for vertue and religion are renowned: but let them envy the good, and maligne them to the uttermoſt, <hi>Rumpanturilia Codro,</hi> yet let us lay aſide all maliciouſneſſe, and all guile, and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and all envy.</p>
               <p>The eye of envy lookes ever upward, who is above, who riſeth, who proſpereth, who is well ſpoken of, well thought of, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God, and aſmuch grieved is an envious man, at the good of another, as at the harme of himſelfe, which <hi>Diogenes</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when he ſaw a knowne envious knave, looke ſad; no man can tell (quoth he) whither harme hath happened to this fellow or good unto his neighbour, for both vexe him alike.</p>
               <p>Envy was the firſt venome, which the Divell powred forth againſt mankind: <hi>Hinc periit primus, &amp; perdidit,</hi> by this the firſt <note place="margin">Cypr.</note> man periſhed himſelfe and deſtroyed others: what was the cauſe that <hi>Caine</hi> ſlew his brother, his onely comfort in that new borne world? was it not envy, when he ſaw the gift of his brother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and his owne rejected, he was very wrath, <hi>And his countenance fel down,</hi> as not able to endure the ſight of his brother. <note place="margin">Gen.</note>

               <p>Becauſe the women ſang in the ſtreets, <hi>Saul hath ſlaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and David his ten thouſand:</hi> therefore was <hi>Saul</hi> exceeding <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</note> wroth, and had envy to <hi>David</hi> ever after. It was (ſaith the King of Preachers) a venimous miſchievous eye, ſuch as the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eyes of Witches, or the Baſiliske, or <hi>Gorgon,</hi> that he caſt towards him. The elder brother when he underſtood of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, that his father gave to his prodigall brother, and with what joy and rejoycing he was entertained, <hi>Hee was angry at the matter, and would not goe in,</hi> he envied it. Examine the reaſon, why Innocencie it ſelfe was hunted and followed unto death, with <hi>Cruciſie him, crucifie him, hee is not worthy to live;</hi> Was it not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.</note> envy? Let <hi>Pilat</hi> be judge, <hi>He knew that for envy they had dilivered him.</hi> Doe wee looke that envy, ſhould favour the honour and welfare of men, when it favoureth not the life of a man? No, not the life of the Lord himſelfe? Poyſon they ſay, is life to the Serpent, death to a man; and that which is life to a man, his ſpittle and naturall humidity, is death to a Serpent. I have read it thus applied<hi>:</hi> Vertue and Felicity, which is life to a good man, is death to the envious: and that which the envious live by, is the miſery and death of a good man: for envy endevoreth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that men may not live at all, or that they may live miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And therefore amongſt other fruits of a reprobate minde, theſe two are joyned together, <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Murther;</hi> and likewiſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> amongſt the workes of the fleſh, they are in the ſame combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they were twinnes growing in one body, and could not be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>Envy is the roote of all miſchiefe in the World: this is that Troiane horſe, that <hi>Pandora's</hi> boxe, full of all deadly poyſon, that <hi>Hydra,</hi> not with ſeven heads, but with ſeven hundred heads of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. We marvell that there is ſo much evill in the world, but ceaſe to marvel at it, ſeeing there is ſo much envious pride in the World. For envy commeth from this maſter ſinne, Pride, which is as a maſter-pock, and cannot be healed. Pride, is a liking of our ſelves, and envie is the hatred of another mans felicity; where the firſt is, there is the ſecond, <hi>Superbia eſt metropolis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um vitiorum,</hi> Pride is the chiefe or mother ſin of all ſins; <hi>Minores deſpicit, majoribus invidet, ab aequalibus diſſentit:</hi> She ſcorneth her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, envieth her betters, and diſſenteth from all equals: as was ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> the one could not abide a ſuperiour, the other, an equall. Two things be in the Lord, Glory and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; the proud man robbeth God of the one, as <hi>Herod,</hi> who would not give the glory to God: and the malitious envious of <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">The etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of envie it implying to be in the eye.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi> Envy is as the dung of ſwallowes, which put out the eyes of Father <hi>Tobias:</hi> our pride and envie is infinite, wee would be Kings, nay, wee would bee Gods.

               <p>The Poet deſcribeth envy thus;</p>

So then, envy, hatred, and backbiting, alwayes goe together, as three can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and evill ſores that conſume the body, hurt the good name, leſſen the gifts, and repine at the good of our brethren. <hi>Baſill</hi> compares envious men to Ravens, that flye over ſweet Gardens, and at laſt ſeize upon a Carrion.

               <p>Theſe are the ſteps and ſtayres to bring men to Heaven, and and therefore ſo long as men be covetous, it is impoſſible for them to come there.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>poore in ſpirit,</hi> he cannot be; for he ſo feareth purſe-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, that he feeles not the miſery, into which the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his owne ſinnes have caſt him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he cannot <hi>mourne</hi> for his ſinnes; for worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and vexation doe turne the ſtreame of weeping quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Pure in heart,</hi> hee cannot be; for he that hath the root of all evill in his heart, cannot have a pure heart.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, he is no <hi>peacemaker:</hi> croſſe him in his penny, and he will trouble all the world; for all the world can tell, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe is the father, mother, and nurſe of moſt debates and ſtrifes that are in the world; covetouſneſſe wil not loſe a penny, he will give the Lawyer a pound firſt.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the covetous man will never <hi>ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſse ſake;</hi> his goods are his god, and if he come to thoſe termes, that he muſt either leave riches or righteouſneſſe, 'tis righteouſneſſe that hee will forſake before riches; the world is his Miſtreſſe, hee muſt embrace her, then farewell righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>So that now a man may very truely turne the ſpeech of our Saviour againſt the covetous man, and ſay, Curſed be the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; for he is not poore in ſpirit, and therefore the kingdome of Hell is his.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he cannot mourne for his ſinnes, but for his loſſes onely, therefore hee ſhall never bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he is not meeke, but froward in heart, and therefore he ſhall not inherit the earth, which hee ſo much wiſheth.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he doth not long after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but after riches; and therefore hee ſhall never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>Curſed bee the covetous, for he is not mercifull, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, therefore he ſhall finde no mercy.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he is no peace-maker, but a make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and therefore he ſhall be called the child of the divell.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he is not pure, but filthy in heart, and therefore he ſhall never ſee God.</p>
               <p>Curſed be the covetous, for he cannot ſuffer the loſſe of his wealth for righteouſneſſe ſake, and therefore the Kingdome of Hell is his.</p>
               <p>And is it thus? is covetouſneſſe the occaſion of ſo much evill? <hi>Let us take heed and beware of covetouſneſſe;</hi> and let us <hi>have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi>

The ghoſtly evils are our ſinnes, as ſuperſtition, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ſwearing, and blaſphemy, profaning of the Sabbath, and neglecting of the Word, contempt of lawfull authorities, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and cruell hatred, chambering and wantonneſſe, &amp;c. And will a golden plaiſter heale theſe diſeaſes? No, no. A man ſhall not leave his ſinnes the ſooner, for that hee is rich, and hath his purſe full with <hi>Dives,</hi> his coffers full with <hi>Croeſus,</hi> his grounds full of cattell with <hi>Iob,</hi> his barnes full of corne with the <hi>Epulo:</hi> it is not wealth that wil make him leave his ſins, but weeping, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, praying, and crying to God for mercy; this is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that muſt heale the ſoule.</p>
               <p>And as wealth cannot preſerve us from Ghoſtly, no more can it from temporall evils, for can it drive away the gout, the ſtone, the collicke, the feaver, the plague, the head-ach, the tooth-ach, yea a fellon or a white-loe, or any greater, or leſſer diſeaſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? No, no, the frogges of <hi>Egypt</hi> entered into the rich <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.</note> mens houſes of Egypt, as well as the poore: ſo diſeaſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils into rich mens bodies, as ſoone as into poore mens carkaſſes.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will adde one thing more which perhaps you will thinke ſtrange, wealth cannot keepe a man from poverty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know yee will deny this; I will bring in ſeventy Kings at a time, to take their oathes upon it. Looke into the booke of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and yee ſhall find ſeventy Kings, with their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and toes cut off, glad like whelpes to licke up crummes under another Kings table. And then a little while after, yee ſhal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1. 6.</note> ſee that the ſame King, that made all of them ſo poore, is uſed in the ſame ſort himſelfe. What beggers brat could come to more need? Now deny if yee can, but that a rich man may dye a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as well as hee that is ſo borne. I have knowne many that from great wealth have come to a morſell of bread; whoſe youth ſwimming in dainties, in old age were glad to ſnap at a cruſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, for inward troubles, riches cannot free us of them<hi>:</hi> Nay, as cobwebs breed ſooner in Waineſcot, &amp; faire hangings,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:15606:145"/>
than upon a plaine wall: ſo thoſe that are rich, are more clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Riches hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</note> with theſe things, than the poore. When a rich man lyes ſicke of any diſeaſe, hath he one pang the leſſe? or is hee able to beare one fit more patiently, becauſe hee can make a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inventory than his neighbour? No, rather it makes his croſſe heavyer. Yee ſee then, wealth connot profit a mans eſtate; Why ſhould wee then gape after it, as Ravens for heate, and bee carried away, with the deceit of <hi>Balaams</hi> wages?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, wealth is hurtfull and dangerous, and yet the hurt proceeds not from the nature of wealth, but from the corruption of men: as cold drinke in it ſelfe, is good, but to him that hath an Ague, hurtfull, and as bad as poyſon. Wealth is like an Hartichoake, a little picking meate there is, not ſo wholeſome as delicious, and nothing to that it ſhewes for, more than the tenth part is unprofitable leaves, and beſides there is a coare in the middeſt of it that will ſtrangle you, if yee take not heed: ſuch a thing is wealth, that men ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly deſire, it is like ſome kind of fiſhes ſo full of bones and unſeene, that no man can eate of it without great danger, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he take great heed. But wherein is wealth ſo dangerous? I anſwer, that it is very troubleſome to the outward man: the rich mans plenty will not ſuffer him to ſleepe: his wealth is like a long garment, too ſide, that a man treads upon it often, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a fall: So wealth maketh him many times to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many maladies, and makes him obnoxious to envy, and ſo ſubject to malice, that none are more. But to the ſoule, the deſire of wealth is moſt pernicious: For firſt, it makes the ſoule vainely confident. <hi>The rich mans riches, is a ſtrong tower in his imagination;</hi> Hee thinkes himſelfe by them wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 5.</note> and moated about, though indeed, hee is as open to danger, as other men. Hee thinkes himſelfe ſafe, if he have <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, wealth; and puts his truſt in his uncertaine riches. The Prophet ſayes, they <hi>Sacrifice to their Nets, and burne Incenſe to their Yarne;</hi> the meaning is, that the ſame <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>Abac.</hi> 1. 16.</note> confidence, which by Sacrifice and incenſe wee proteſt to God, they put in their wealth. And it is noted, to bee a paſſion of the covetous, to delight in wealth: to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves in their abundance, as if gold were their Sun by day, and ſilver their Moone by night. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Gold and ſilver faſten the feet,</hi> that is, the covetous man <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 40. 25.</note> he thinkes he ſtands firme on no ground, but on that which is paved with gold.</p>
               <p>But there is yet more evill in wealth; it maketh men proud; <hi>Charge rich men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that they bee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>not high-minded:</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that pride is the rich mans Couſin. It is the nature of wealth, when it falleth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15606:146"/>
into vile mens hands, to blow up the heart, as a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Pride blowes up the heart.</note> is blowne with a quill. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The rich fall into luſts and temptations.</hi> To conclude, from wealth growes ſecurity, as a dead ſleepe from drunkenneſſe: Let us then beware of this ſinne, that wee never bee carryed away with the deceit of <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, that wee be not covetous as hee was.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The learned make three kindes of Government, and all to bee obeyed.</p>
               <p>As firſt, a <hi>Monarchie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, an <hi>Aristocracie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, a <hi>Democratie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the which they oppoſe <hi>Tyrannidem, Oligarchiam, Anarchiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our regiment is a Monarchy; that of the <hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> ſeemeth to be an Ariſtocracie; that of the Low-countries, a Democratie: which of theſe three is the beſt, is not agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the learned. Some doe advance the government of many; becauſe many are not ſo ſoone corrupted as one may be; even as a great quantity of water will not ſo ſoone putrifie, as will a ſmall portion. But theſe muſt on the other ſide conſider,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15606:147"/>
that it is a great deale more hard to find many good than one: <note place="margin">Reaſons why Monarchy is the beſt forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and it is moſt likely, that ſuch an one will prove beſt, whom the Nobility of Royall bloud, and Princely examples of predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors doe invite unto vertue.</p>
               <p>Others doe advance the government of one, becauſe it is firſt, moſt agreeable to nature: as <hi>Ierome</hi> doth witneſſe, ſaying, <hi>In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus principes ſunt; grues unum ſequuntur ordine literato: Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor unus; Dux unus provinciae, in navi unus gubernator, in domo unus dominus, &amp;c.</hi> Bees have their chiefe governour; the Cranes doe follow one another in an exquiſite order: there is one chiefe commander, one chiefe Iudge of a Province, one governour of all in the Ship, one maſter in an houſe, in an army, be it never ſo great, the Enſigne of one is ſpecially regarded, and attended on. In the body of Man, though the Lims, and parts thereof be many, yet they all obey one head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, moſt fit for cutting off ſeditions and rebellions: and therefore the <hi>Romanes</hi> in all their greateſt dangers, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto this; <hi>Tanquam ad anchoram ſacram,</hi> as to their ſhot-anchor, as to their beſt and laſt refuge; as <hi>Livie</hi> witneſſeth; for when <hi>Hannibal</hi> preſſed the <hi>Romanes, Ad Dictatorem dicendum, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medium jam diu deſideratum Civitas confugit,</hi> The City went to the pronouncing of a Dictator, which was the remedy they long expected, becauſe (as in another place he writeth) <hi>Dictatoris edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum pro numine ſemper obſervatum eſt;</hi> the proclamation of the Dictator was eſteemed to be the voyce of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The government of one doth ſeeme to reſemble moſt lively the image of Gods Power and Majeſtie. For as in the Firmament, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, doe as it were repreſent ſome image of the glory of the eternall Majeſtie: So the rule of Monarchs in their ſeverall Kingdomes upon the earth, doe call to our conſiderations, the government and rule of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>But whether the government of one, or many, be beſt, I dare not define: but this I ſay, that it is a moſt ſingular token of the mighty Power and Providence of God, that ſo many ſeverall Nations over the face of the World, are upholden and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſo many ſeverall ſorts of government, that <hi>Quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum non niſi in aequali temperatura elementa inter ſe cohaerent: Ita hae Regiones ſua quadam in aequalitate optimè continentur:</hi> As in bodily eſſences, the foure Elements doe cleaue together by unequall temperatures, as it were by a certaine inequality, all the ſeveral Countries are holden together: Nay, which of all theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments is the beſt, <hi>Otioſum eſt diſputare,</hi> it is a very idle thing to diſpute; but moſt yeeld to this, that a Monarchy is the moſt perfect, and the bleſſing of God ſeene in that chiefly: <hi>Perme Reges regnant:</hi> By me Kings raigne, &amp; Noble men beare rule, ſaith Wiſedome: He therefore that reſiſteth, <hi>Reſisteth not man, but God</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:15606:148"/>
alſo. True it is, that man was made to rule, not to ſerve: he was <note place="margin">Rebellion brings deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Rebels themſelves.</note> made to rule over fowles, fiſhes, cattell, but not men. At the firſt, men were <hi>pecorum paſtores, potius quàm Reges hominum;</hi> feeders of cattell, than rulers over men; that we might diſcerne the order of creation, from the merit of ſinne. So we reade not of any ſervant <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note> before <hi>Cham,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> For as ſinne brought in the firſt death, the firſt ſorow, the firſt nakedneſſe, the firſt flood: So it brought in the firſt ſervice. If man had not ſinned, <hi>Moſes</hi> had not needed in the kingdome, nor <hi>Aaron</hi> in the Church; the one to rule the bodies, the other the ſoules of men.</p>
               <p>Rebellion of all ſins is unnaturall: for what can be more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, then the child to rebell againſt the father, the wife againſt the husband, the ſervant againſt the Maſter? and no leſſe unnaturall is it, for the ſubject to rebell againſt his Soveraigne. Rebellion God never proſpered: hereupon ſaith <hi>Salomon, My ſonne, feare God and the King, and keepe no companie with the ſeditious, for their deſtruction ſhall</hi>

In <hi>Geneſis</hi> we reade, that five kings, with their armies could not prevaile againſt <hi>Chodorlaomer,</hi> unto whom they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</note> promiſed loyalty, and obedience, but they were all overthrown and taken priſoners by him: but <hi>Abraham</hi> with his family &amp; kinsfolkes, an handfull of men in reſpect, owing no ſubjection to <hi>Chedorla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omer,</hi> overthrew him and his hoaſt in battell. Thus God proſpereth in battell ſome few againſt many thouſands: but he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered Rebels againſt their owne Prince, were they never ſo great or noble, ſo ſtout, ſo politick, but alwayes they were overthrowne, and came to moſt ſhamefull ends.</p>
               <p>And to inſtance but upon a few: One <hi>Brennus</hi> captaine of the <hi>Gaules</hi> beſieging <hi>Epheſus,</hi> had the City betraied into his hands by a treacherous woman, for the greedy deſire of a Iewell, that a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wore: but when ſhe had plaied this tteaſonable part, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her with gold. A certaine traytour offred <hi>Fabritius</hi> the

               <p>In the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. divers noble men and kings rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and came every one of them to a miſerable end.</p>

                  <p>IN this Text are contained two things.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>detection of their ſinnes,</hi> and</p>
                  <p>A <hi>denouncing of Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſinnes here are three.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Epicuriſme,</hi> in that they eate and drinke without feare, feeding themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Pride,</hi> in that they are like the waves of the Sea, ſwelling on high.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> in that they are as clouds promiſing raine, and yet have nothing but dryneſſe in them; empty clouds, in that they are as Trees, which promiſe fruit, and yet have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but leaves; corrupt trees; in that they are as ſtarres, which promiſe light, and yet have nothing but darkneſſe in them, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſtarres.</p>
                  <p>Their Iudgement is to be reſerved to blacke darkneſſe, that is, Hell fire hell paines; and there hee amplifieth it, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Gods Iudgement, how hee ſhall come with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Angels, and that he ſhall judge all men, namely, them <note place="margin">

                  <p>But firſt for the manner, and then for the matter. The manner of handling is plaine, he teacheth them by plain things, as ſpots, waves, clouds, trees, ſtarres, things ſenſible, and objected to our eyes, becauſe he had a deſire to profit them: So Chriſts ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are fetched from light, ſalt, fannes, corne, chaffe, trees, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>was rude in ſpeaking,</hi> that is, though he uſed no worldly eloquence, <hi>yet for knowledge and underſtanding hee did exceed, and ſpake with tongues more than they all:</hi> his Epiſtles are as the ſhop of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary; <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5, 6.</note> a man cannot read them, but he ſhall carry away the ſmell ofexcellent learning; yet <hi>came he not in the wiſdome of words,</hi>

                  <p>But wee muſt deſire wholeſome, not tooth-ſome meat: For as we muſt teach wholeſome Doctrine, <hi>For if any man teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi>

               <p>Generally, pride is expreſſed either in things concerning God; <note place="margin">Ierome.</note> or in things appertaining to men.</p>
               <p>In the things that concerne God, there is the pride of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, whereby he ſtriveth to remove the ſenſe of the being of God; and the pride of the heretike, when he aſſaults the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, or his perſons; and the pride of the Papiſt, who will ſcale the high Fort of heaven by the broken ladder of his owne merits; and the pride of the curious, who will ſearch into things not revealed; and the pride of the perſecutor, who will purſue by ſlaunders or violence, the power of Gods ordinances; and the pride of the impenitent; who dare live and dye in his ſinnes, without care of Gods threatnings. Againe, pride is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed againſt God, as firſt when a man imagineth himſelfe to be God, and would bee ſo conceited of men, as <hi>Caligula,</hi> who (being an open mocker of all religion) at length fell to thinke, that there was no other God but himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when men imagine, that what they have, they have it of themſelves, and ſo <hi>ſacrifice to their nets,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when in their hearts they ſay, <hi>He ſhall not raigne over us. Who ſhall controle us?</hi> and ſo contemne the ordinances of God, his Word, his Sacraments, their worke, their power.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when a man ſhall thinke he is perfect and breakes not the Law, and that they can by their owne ſtrength <hi>runne the way of Gods Commandements.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, when in heart they ſay, We will do this and this: who ſhall let us? we will go thither and thither, who ſhall hinder us?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, when men will diſobey the will of God; breake his yoke, and burſt his bonds aſunder. Thus is pride againſt God ſhewed manywayes.</p>
               <p>Pride againſt man diſcovereth it ſelfe ſundry wayes alſo,</p>
               <p>As by oppugning the fame of the beſt men:</p>
               <p>By bragging and boaſting.</p>
               <p>By ſtriving for offices and higheſt places.</p>
               <p>By coſtly apparell, of purpoſe to be counted better men then they be.</p>
               <p>By painting of the face, to be thought a beautifull creature, not being ſo.</p>
               <p>By envying the good of another, as if he deemed himſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only worthy, or elſe the moſt worthy.</p>
               <p>The proud man will acknowledge no ſuperiour nor equall by his good will: hee uſeth his equals as inferiours, his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, as ſervants, his ſervants, as ſlaves, his ſlaves, as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15606:156"/>

Thus pride is expreſſed both to God and man. <hi>David</hi> was farre from this pride, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>high-minded, I have no proud lookes: I do not exerciſe my ſelfe in matters, that are too high for me, &amp;c.</hi> But few are like <hi>David:</hi> many men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves to be men, they take to them the name of God, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14. 13.</note> as <hi>Herod</hi> did; they will make their neſts in the ſtarres, as <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> did. The <hi>Bactrians</hi> ſaid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that his pride was ſuch, that if his body had been anſwerable to his heart, he would ſet one foot on the land, and the other on the ſea: For our pride is infinite.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſo much in the rich, as in the poore; the pooreſt, the baſeſt are many times the proudeſt; prettie is the parable of <hi>Iotham;</hi> the beſt trees refuſed to be the King, but the bramble affected it, &amp; did <hi>ſperare &amp; aſpirare,</hi> hope &amp; aſpire, as did the baſtard <hi>Abimelech.</hi>

None prouder then the baſeſt and the meaneſt: If they haue but a little mucke, or a few cloddes, to commend them, a little land, they looke aloft, and a King muſt not be their Couſin.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of them that liue under the North Pole, that no plant groweth in Summer, for the great heate there, nor none in Winter for the extreme cold: So no vertue can grow in our Climate; not in rich, for they are proud, nor in the poore, for they are prouder.</p>
               <p>We all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the envy, the quarrelling, the ſtrife, the ſuites, the troubles of this age: but where is the roote of all theſe, but pride?

               <p>Heereupon it came to paſſe, that Chriſt dealt not ſo hardly with any ſinners, no not with Atheiſts that denied the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Gods power; nor with Temporizers, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the ſame Religion that the company is: that can blow hot and cold with one breath, as with hypocrites: for having to deale with Sadduces, he ſhaketh them off, as damned creatures, as veſſels of deſtruction, children of wrath, whoſe judgement was juſt, and their damnation ſlept not: hee telleth them, that they erred; <hi>Ye erre</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures, neither</hi>

               <p>And it is not to bee forgotten, that God calleth it blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to ſpeake one thing, and to doe another; with man, it is hypocriſie, but to doe ſo with God, it is blaſphemy; the ſinne increaſeth, as the dignity of the perſon increaſeth<hi>:</hi> as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſpeake a word againſt a common perſon, and hee hath but his action of the Caſe againſt thee, ſpeake againſt a noble man, it is <hi>Scandalum Magnatum;</hi> againſt the Prince, it is death; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, it is damnation of body and ſoule: double and diſſemble with men, it is hypocriſie; halt with God, counterfeit with him, it is blaſphemy.

We profeſſe Religion, we come to the Church, we heare the Word for ſhew only, for faſhion only, of cuſtome, not of conſcience. <hi>Dagon</hi> of the Philiſtines, and the Arke of God is all one to us; the temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and the temple of <hi>Rimmon</hi> is all one; the ſervice of God, and the worſhip of <hi>Diana</hi> is all one. <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Samaria, Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Ierico:</hi> the Goſpeland the Maſſe, to us are both alike.</p>

               <p>It is monſtrous for trees to ſtand ſeven and ſeven yeeres, yea forty, fifty, nay ſixty yeeres and more, and to yeeld no fruit. For us to live long in the Church, and to doe no good.

               </p>
               <p>And Saint <hi>Iude</hi> tells us, that theſe trees be twice dead, and plucked up by the rootes: dead in worke and deed, and inword; dead <hi>tam in ramis bonorum operum,</hi> aſwell in the boughes of good workes, <hi>quàm in radicibus fidei,</hi> as in the rootes of faith, twice dead, becauſe according to the fleſh they be moſt corrupt, and according to the ſoule moſt perverſe, twice dead, dead to God, dead unto the world; both in this world, and in the world to come. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh three deaths; the death of the ſoule, the death of the body, the death of both body and ſoule, called the ſecond death: the firſt death is here meant.</p>

The torments invented by tyrants, and inflicted upon the Saints and ſervants of God, have beene moſt hideous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; as the teeth of wild beaſts, hot glowing Ovens and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, caldrons of boyling oyle, fiery brazen bulles, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to death in morters, rowling in barrelles of nayles, roſting upon ſpits, boaring with angers, parting the nayles, and fingers ends with Needles, nipping the fleſh with pinſers, racking and rending aſunder the joynts with wilde horſes; no pitty, no remorſe taken, whileſt there was either fleſh or blood, or ſynew, or bone: but the torments of Hell are greater, the mourning of <hi>Hannah,</hi> the griefe of <hi>Iob,</hi> the ſorrow of <hi>David,</hi> the lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> the bitter ſmart of Ieruſalem were great, as much

If all griefes and woes, and as many beſides as ever wrung and wreſted the ſpirit and heart of man, ſince the breath of life was breathed into him, were put together, to part the torments of Hell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them part after part, as if they would empty the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and breake the ſtreame of it, yet hath the hand of Hell an unmeaſurable portion behinde, to diſtribute to her children, an endleſſe patrimony of how ling and wringing and gnaſhing; which all the foreprized griefes and torments of this life, have ſcarce beene ſhadowes and counterfeits of: all the paines in the World are nothing to the paines of Hell: therefore ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, If <hi>thy hand and thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and caſt them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt and maimed, than having two hands, and two feete, to bee caſt into everlaſting fire, Mat.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
               <p>Againe, as two contraries ſet together, the one doth ſet out the other, as blacke being ſet by white, ſeemeth the blacker, and gall ſet by honey, ſeemeth the bitterer; for <hi>contrariorum contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria eſt ratio;</hi> therefore whatſoever can bee ſaid of the joyes of Heaven, may bee ſaid of the paines of Hell.

Now if a litle griefe be ſo great in this life, what ſhall bee their griefe, when the ſtreames of Gods wrath ſhall fall upon them?</p>
               <p>How fearefull have Gods iudgements beene againſt ſinne in this life?

                  <hi>Granatenſis</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nil tam durum, quàm cor hominis,</hi> nothing ſo hard as a mans heart: <hi>Omnia dura metalla igne liqueſcunt,</hi> all hard metals are ſoftned with fire; the iron is diſſolved in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; the Adamant broken with the blood of a Goate; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed ice and ſnow molten with the Sunne; the hard marble pearced with droppes, the hard rocks rent aſunder with ſtrokes: <hi>At cor humanum durius petra, durius ferro; durius Adamante:</hi> but the heart of man is harder than the rocke, harder than the iron, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the Adamant: <hi>nec amor Deite mollat,</hi> neither can the love of God mollify thee, <hi>nec ſanguis Chriſti te frangat,</hi> nor the blood of Chriſt breake thee; <hi>nec ignis inferni te moveat,</hi> nor the fire of hell move thee: For vile men ſavour nothing, either of the ioyes of heaven, or paines of hell: they are as men without taſte, whoſe palates are corrupted with humours, that they are not able to diſcerne betweene hony and gall; they neither ſavour Gods threatnings of wrath, nor promiſes of grace; they will ſtill draw iniquity with cordes of vanity, and ſinne like cartropes.</p>
               <p>But to follow this matter of hell and of the torments thereof a little more fully: As the paines of hell be vnvtterable: For all the tortures and torments of the world are but flea-bitings to the torments of hell<hi>:</hi> ſo are they everlaſting, they abide not for a day, a weeke, a moneth, a yeere, but for ever. Hell is like the ſtone in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> called <hi>Abeſtos,</hi> which being ſet on fire, never goeth out; <hi>facilis eſt deſcenſus adinfernum, difficile revertere gradum;</hi> It is an eaſy matter to deſcend into hell, but not eaſy to returne backe.</p>
               <p>To all men in miſery, there is hope, that once they ſhall have an end; the mariner comforteth himſelfe with arrivall; the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, with hope of victory; the priſoner, with a gaole-delivery; the prentice with freedome; but in hell, <hi>nulla res, nulla ſpes,</hi> there
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:15606:167"/>
is no end of that miſery: the captivity of Hell is not like the <note place="margin">Hell torments everlaſting.</note> captivity of Iſrael in Aegypt, which laſted foure hundred and thirty yeeres, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 40. nor like the captivity of Babylon, which continued ſeventy yeeres, but the captivity of Hell is like the captivity of Iſrael in Syria; they never returned againe: So in hell there is no redemption. The greateſt croſſe that can bee laid upon man in this life, is to bee caſt into perpetuall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to loſe lands and goods, and want the company of our wives and children, and other our friends that love us; but yet in this caſe wee alwayes live in hope of liberty, and releaſe of our puniſhment; or if our hope bee vaine, yet God will ſtirre up the hearts of ſtrangers to viſit us, to pittie us, to comfort and releeve us, ſome with meate, ſome with money, ſome with cloth, ſome with counſell; every man as hee is able, and hath compaſſion and feeling of our eſtate: but out of hell there is no redemption, no hope of paines to bee ever ended or eaſed, no frineds to pitty us, to ſee us, to ſpeake with us, or to comfort us. If a barne were full of corne, and a bird once every yeere ſhould carry away one kernell thereof, at laſt it would bee all gone; If a mountaine twenty miles about had taken from it once every yeere a ſhovell full, at laſt it would bee all conſumed; but it would be long firſt, yet at laſt there would be an end; but in hell there is no end: thoſe torments are everlaſting; the dayes of the helliſh torments of the damned ſhall never weare out, nor their yeeres come to an end: the longer they continue, the leſſe hope they have; when as many yeeres are expired, as there bee men in the world, and ſtarres in the heavens; when as many thouſand yeeres are ended as there bee ſtones, and ſands by the ſea-ſhore, yet ſtill there bee tenne hundred thouſand times ſo many moe to come; the miſeries of the wicked ſhall laſt as long as God ſhall live, &amp; that is ever. For he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, Apoc.</hi> 1. The covenant of the day and night ſhall one day bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the ſtarres ſhall finiſh their race, the Elements melt with heate, heaven and earth bee renewed, ſummer and winter have an end, but the plagues of the priſoners in hell ſhall never be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For in hell, as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, there is <hi>Mors ſine morte, finis ſine fine,</hi> an end not ending, a death not dying, unquenchable fire, yet a darkeneſſe therewithall to accompany it, more palpable than the frogges of Aegypt, and blacker then blackneſſe it ſelfe; everlaſting, burning, but not conſuming: For the damned, quoth <hi>Greg.</hi> ſuffer an end without an end, a death without a death, a decay without a decay: for their death ever liveth, their end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beginneth, their decay never ceaſeth; they are ever healed, to bee new wounded; and are alwayes repaired, to bee new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured: they are ever dying, and never dead, eternally broiled, and never burnt up. For the fire of Hell differeth from our fire in many properties: Firſt, in <hi>Heate,</hi> for our fire compared to hell
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15606:168"/>
fire, is but as fire painted upon a wall, yet is it a painefull thing <note place="margin">Hell fire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary and ordinary fire.</note> for a man to hold his finger in the fire an houre, the ſmart is ſo grievous, but it is more painefull to hold his hand in the fire an houre, and yet more painfull to hold his whole arme; but yet more painefull to hold his whole body: O how great will it be, to have our bodies and ſoules tormented in the flames of Hell fire? all the tongues of men and Angels cannot expreſſe the griefe and ſmart thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the fire of Hell differeth from our fire, in <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:</hi> for our fire may bee quenched, hell-fire cannot: <hi>For the breath of the Lord is as a river of brimſtone to kindle it.</hi> And therefore ſo long as the Lord breatheth, that is, liveth, ſo long that fire burneth, and that is ever: therefore it is called <hi>everlaſting hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, Mat.</hi> 25. If any man aske, how that fire can be everlaſting, <hi>cum ſit corruptibile elementum;</hi> yee ſhall underſtand, that this fire is not nouriſhed and continued with wood, and other matter, <hi>ſed ſola Dei voluntate,</hi> it is the will of God, that it ſhould ever burne: and therefore it burneth everlaſtingly. <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 21. <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> proveth it by the examples of the mountaines of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia,</hi> which have ever burned ſince the beginning of the world, and yet doe burne, and are not conſumed.</p>
               <p>Finely ſaith a Schooleman, <hi>Lacus inferni tali igne repletus eſt, ut ſi totum mare in eo influeret, non extingueretur: infoelix anima, quae tanto &amp; tam diuturno igne cruciatur:</hi> The infernall lake is filled with ſuch fire, that if the whole ſea ſhould overflow it, it would not put it out: unhappy ſoule, the which is tormented with ſuch and ſo laſting fire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the fire of hell differeth from our fire in <hi>light;</hi> for our fire yeeldeth light, hell fire nothing but darkeneſſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hell is called darkeneſſe; <hi>Blackneſse of darkneſſe;</hi> and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of darkneſſe for evermore. <hi>Take him,</hi> ſaith the Goſpell, <hi>bind him hand and foote, Mat.</hi> 22. What? no more but ſo? <hi>I lictor, liga manus,</hi> Goe Sergeant, bind his hands? yes; caſt him into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkeneſſe; outward to thoſe inward, wherein they deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, blindneſſe of mind and underſtanding; outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole man, body and ſoule, ſhall bee folded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended therein; outward, becauſe in extremity without any limits, and borders of any favour of God, to bee extended; where neither the light of Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and much leſſe the ſight of Gods glorious face ſhall ever ſhine. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ignis Gehennae lucebit miſeris, ad miſeriae augmentum, ut vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant unde doleant; non ad conſolationem, ut videant, unde gaudeant:</hi> Hell fire gives light to the damned ſoule, to increaſe their miſery, that they may ſee wherefore to grieve; not for their comfort, that they might ſee any cauſe to rejoice for.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, our fire differeth from hell fire in <hi>conſuming:</hi> for our fire conſumeth all that is put into it, but hell fire conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:15606:168"/>
nothing. <hi>Semper comburentur, nunquam conſumentur,</hi> they ſhall <note place="margin">Hel fire burne, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</note> alwayes bee burning, never be conſumed. If any aske, How this can bee, that a man ſhall alway burne in hell, and never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed? I anſwere, that it is the nature of this fire alwayes to burne the bodies and ſoules of the damned, and yet never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or make an end of them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that God worketh ſtrangely in his creatures; as for example, the Salamander li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the fire; take him out of the fire and hee dieth. And there bee certaine creatures, that live in hot ovens and chimneies, as the crickets. Take the coales of Iuniper, and rake them up in the aſhes of it, and they will keep fire a yeere. Take a Peacocke, and kill it, and the fleſh thereof (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) will remaine ſweet and continue without putrefaction a yeere. Take Chaffe, and it preſerveth ſnow, that is wrapped up in it, and melloweth fruit. Take lime, and bring it to the Sunne, and it is cold, caſt it into the water, and it burneth. Againe, the Adamant is not broken, but by the blood of a Goate: and who can give a reaſon for it? There is a fountaine in <hi>Epyrus,</hi> which will put out a candle if it burne, and light a candle if it be out. The horſes of <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> conceive with the wind. God thus worketh ſtrangely in his creatures: why not in the fire of hell?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, our fire differeth from hell fire in this; our fire but burnes and torments the body; but hell fire torments both body and ſoule. Hereupon ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Feare not him that is able to kill the body, and hath no power over the ſoule; but feare him that is able to ſend both body and ſoule into everlaſting hell fire, Mat.</hi> 10. Theſe are the differences betweene our fire and hell fire: the thought of this ſhould make our bodyes to tremble, and our hearts to melt, and the haire of our head to ſtand upright, and to deſire God to deliver us from this Lions denne<hi>:</hi> For when a man is once in, there is no getting out; the gates of hell are kept from egreſſe, as the gates of Paradiſe were warded from entrance, not by Cherubins, with the blade of a ſword, but by the angels of Satan, with all the inſtruments of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> that have been ſo many thouſand yeeres in this torment, their paines are as great now, as they were at the firſt. The accurſed glutton in the Goſpell, who could ſpeake by experience of his unſpeakable diſcrutiations, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> could of the troubles of <hi>Troy,</hi> he would have a warning given to all his brethren in the fleſh, to make men take heed of hell, and of the torments of that place; the flames and fervour wherof were ſuch, that he craved with more ſtreames of teares, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever <hi>Eſau</hi> ſought his bleſſing, but one droppe of water to coole his tongue with, and could not obtaine it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. This made <hi>Bernard</hi> to crie; <hi>Paveo gehennam, paveo Iudicis vultum, &amp;c.</hi> I dread Hell, I dread the Iudges contenance. If <hi>Bernard</hi> thus trembled, what ſhall we doe? <hi>Auguſtine, libro de anima, &amp;c. cap.</hi> 56. ſaith, <hi>Omnino miſeris</hi>

                  <hi>erit mors, ſine morte, defectus, ſine defectu, ſemper tolerabunt, ſemper ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebunt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iudgement neceſſary to be denounced in time of ſin.</note> To the damned ſhall be alwayes a death without death, and a decay without decay; they ſhall alwayes bee in paine, and alwayes be in feare. For they ſhall alwayes bee in paine, and alwayes be in feare. For they ſhall be tormented without hope of pardon: <hi>Videbunt daemones, &amp; Deum non videbunt,</hi> they ſhall ſee the Divels, and not God. There ſhall be the hangman alway tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and the worme alway gnawing.</p>
               <p>Anger not therefore, offend not this Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> leſt hee anger you, and caſt you into the Divels dungeon; <hi>Vbi progredi intolerabile, regredi impoſſibile:</hi> Where to goe forward is intolerable, to goe backward impoſſible.</p>
               <p>I have ſtood ſo much the longer upon the paines of hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would awake you from the Lethargy of your ſinnes; For I ſee, the world is come unto the ſtay, that it was in <hi>Eſayes</hi> dayes, <hi>Let mercy be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learne righteouſneſse, Eſay.</hi> 26. Preach honour, and glory, and peace, a garland of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, an uncorruptible crowne, fruit of the tree of life, ſight of the face of God, following the Lambe, fellowſhip with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, and the congregation of the firſt borne; new names, and white garments, pleaſures at the right hand of God, and fulneſſe of ioy in his preſence for evermore, unto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet are they obſtinately bent, and unmoveably ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſings of God, as <hi>Daniel</hi> againſt the hire of <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Keep thy reward to thy ſelfe, and give thy gifts to another, Dan.</hi> 5. And therefore becauſe the bleſſing of the ſix Levits upon mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> will not moove them, I have made them to heare the curſing of ſix others upon mount <hi>Ebal:</hi> they take no pleaſure in the beauty of Sion, and therefore I have feared them with the thundrings and lightnings of <hi>Sinai,</hi> and fed them with the <hi>bread of iudgement,</hi> as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> calleth it. I pray God it may worke effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually with them, and make them to ſhake off the burthen of their ſinnes, and turne unto God with unfained converſion.</p>
               <p>One other thing can I not conceale from you, as touching the wicked in hell, and that is, as they have ſinned, ſo their paines ſhall be multiplied. <hi>Vpon the ungodly, God ſhall raine ſnares, fire, brimſtone, ſtorme and tempeſt, this ſhall bee their portion to drinke, Pſal.</hi> 11. 7.

               <p>The firſt judgement was that, that was accompliſhed, of man and Angels at their firſt fall. The Angels that fell, were judged and throwne out of Heaven: <hi>Adam</hi> that fell, was judged and throwne out of Paradiſe. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is generall judgement, of quicke and of dead, whereof <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied here, ſaying, <hi>The Lord will come with thouſands of his Saints, to give iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> But ſome will ſay, Why ſhould God judge man after death, ſince hee hath his judgement at his death? I anſwere, that in death wee have a particular judgement, but God will alſo have his generall <note place="margin">Aug.</note> judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In death we have the judgement of the ſoule: But God will judge both body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In death wee have a ſecret Doome: But God will have an open Aſſiſe, a publike Seſſions, and a manifeſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Concerning which generall Iudgement, I could produce a cloud of Scriptures to avouch it, both out of the old and new Teſtament: <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>An end is come, an end is come, it is looked for: Behold it is come. Moſes</hi> alſo propheſied of this Iudgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 50. and <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9. and <hi>Daniel, Cap.</hi> 7. 13. and <hi>Ioel, Cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Malachy Cap.</hi> 4. So did Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of us Gentiles, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>Peter</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. Neither is this aſſurance of the judgement to come, warranted by the words of Gods ſervants onely, but the Lord hath left many workes of his own, to teach us, that hee will once at length for all, judge the whole World for ſinne. The drowning of the old World, the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were aſſured tokens that the Lord would not put up the infinite iniquities of the World, but will judge it, and puniſhit; the pleading of the Conſcience foretelleth a judgement to come; the ſentence of of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15606:172"/>
in Paradiſe, and renewed with ſuch terrour on mount <note place="margin">The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall iudge.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinai,</hi> did evidently aſſure us, that God meant to call men to judgement; the leſſer judgements in this life are fore-runners to this great and laſt judgement; the dragging of men out of the World by death, is nothing elſe, but an Alarum to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God hath promiſed that there ſhall be a judgement: <hi>I will contend with thee in iudgement,</hi> ſaith God. <hi>The nations ſhall ſee my iudgements,</hi> ſaith God. <hi>I will ſit and iudge the people,</hi> ſaith God. Now all <hi>the promiſes of God, are Yea and Amen,</hi> ſo firmely ratified, that Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but his Word and promiſe ſhall not paſſe. The day and the night may faile in their courſes; the Sunne and Moone may faile in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the Earth may faile and totter upon her props; the Sea and Rivers may faile, and bee emptied of their waters, but the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God ſhall not faile. God promiſed a floud, and it came: <hi>Et qui verus erat in diluvio, cur non in iudicio?</hi> He that performed it in the one, why ſhould he not performe it in the other?</p>
               <p>The Iuſtice of God requireth that there ſhall be a judgement, <hi>Hîc optimi peſſimè agunt;</hi> Here the beſt men are the worſt uſed, and moſt wronged: Here <hi>Iezabel</hi> ſits braving in a window, whileſt <hi>Ieremy</hi> lies ſticking in the mud. Here <hi>Dives</hi> ſits in his palace, cloathed richly, faring daintily, while <hi>Lazarus</hi> lies at his gates naked and hungry: Here <hi>Herod</hi> will pleaſe <hi>Herodias,</hi> though it be with the head of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>(Nonne viſitabit haec?)</hi> ſhall not God viſit &amp; come to iudgement for theſe things? Certainly iudgement will come, and then downe go the wicked, and up the godly: horrour, hell and death ſhall be the doome of the wicked; heaven, ioy and life ſhall be the lot of the righteous. Thus yee ſee there ſhall be a Iudgement.</p>
               <p>I will paſſe on to the next, <hi>Who ſhall be the Iudge in this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> The Lord, <hi>The Lord?</hi> ſaith <hi>Enoch, commeth with thouſands of his Saints, to give iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> And in that the Lord ſhall be our Iudge, there will be firſt, <hi>rectum iudicium,</hi> a right and true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the Lord is true, and cannot faile either: <hi>Ignorantia le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> as not knowing the Law: For he gave the Law, and will iudge according to the Law<hi>:</hi> nor yet <hi>Ignorantia facti,</hi> as not ſeeing the fact; for <hi>his ſeven eyes goe thorow the World.</hi> Yee may interpret them, if yee will, ſeven thouſand thouſand eyes. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if the Lord bee the Iudge, there will bee <hi>aequum iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> his Iudgement will be righteous and good; for <hi>Necerrat ipſe, nec ſuſtinet errantem,</hi> He can neither ſinne himſelfe, nor yet indure a wilfull ſinner<hi>:</hi> wee cannot corrupt him, he hath no need of our goods.</p>
               <p>But when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhall be the Iudge and come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> yee ſhall underſtand, that this word Lord is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time eſſentially; and then it ſignifieth all the three perſons in the Trinity: and ſo it is taken in the <hi>Pſalme, The Lord, even the moſt</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:15606:173"/>
                  <hi>mighty hath ſpoken, and called the round World, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed in <note place="margin">Chriſt ſhall iudge in his humanity.</note> reſpect of authority, the whole Trinity ſhall be the Iudge: but ſometime this word Lord is taken perſonally, and then it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, as here in this my Text, <hi>The Lord ſhall come to Iudgement.</hi> For in reſpect of the execution of this iudgement, Chriſt alone ſhall iudge. And why Chriſt? And not the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt? Firſt, becauſe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us; <hi>The Father hath given all iudgement to the Sonne:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</note> And as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> expounds the words<hi>: non ut Filius ſuus, ſed ut Filius Hominis:</hi> not as hee is the Sonne of God, but as hee is the Sonne of the bleſſed Virgin, borne in the world.</p>
               <p>2. The Sonne iudgeth, and not the Father, becauſe it beſt befitteth a King to iudge his owne ſubiects; and we are now the immediate ſubiects of the Sonne. Indeed in our creation wee were abſolutely the ſubjects of God, but by rebelling againſt God, we became the ſlaves and vaſſals of the Divell, and not the ſubjects of God: yet now being redeemed from death, and from him that hath the power of death, the Divell: by the precious bloud of the Sonne of God, we are become the ſubjects of the Sonne, not that this is to be underſtood, <hi>Excluſive,</hi> as excluding from the worke of our redemption, the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>ſed Appretiative<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as the Schoolemen ſpeake, but becauſe the price of our redemption was paid by the Sonne, and not by the perſon of the Father, or Holy Ghoſt; and in that the Sonne did <hi>ſuſtinere poenas,</hi> undergoe our puniſhment, <hi>et procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare praemia,</hi> purchaſe our reward; hee muſt <hi>diſpenſare praemia &amp; poenas,</hi> both diſpoſe of our puniſhment and reward.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as there be two natures in Chriſt; the Divine, and humane; it may be queſtioned in what forme or Nature hee ſhall iudge? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Eadem forma iudicabit te, qua ſub Iudice ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etit pro te;</hi> In the ſame nature he ſhall iudge thee, wherein he ſtood before the Iudge for thee; he ſhall iudge us not as God, but as man; according to that in the Goſpell, <hi>Yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of Man</hi> (not of God, but of Man) <hi>comming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory. Veniet qui Deus, non qua Deus,</hi> he that ſhall iudge us, is God, but he ſhall not iudge us, as he is God. <hi>Vrſinus</hi> in his Catechiſme <hi>pag.</hi> 451. giveth three reaſons of this; <hi>Quia per eum Mediatorem glorificanda eſt Eccleſia, per quem iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficata eſt;</hi> becauſe the Church is to bee glorified by that Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by which ſhe was iuſtified. <hi>Secundo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ob conſolationem noſtram, dum ſcimus illum fore Iudicem, qui redimit nos; eſt enim frater noſter, &amp; caro noſtra.</hi> Secondly, for our comfort, to give us to underſtand that he ſhall bee our Iudge, which redeemed vs, and is our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and our fleſh. <hi>Tertio, propter iuſtitiam Dei, quia filium hominis contumelia affecerunt.</hi> Thirdly, for the Iuſtice of God, becauſe the Sonne of Man hath beene much reproched with many contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15606:173"/>
and ſlanders. If any man will object, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Though Chriſt ſhall come in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, yet with power and great glory.</note> 
                  <hi>he came not to iudge the World, but to ſave the World:</hi> I anſwere, that theſe words are not to be underſtood of his ſecond, but of his firſt comming into the World: then indeed he came to ſave the World, but now to iudge the World; and he ſhall not iudge it as God, becauſe that as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tollatur impius;</hi> The wicked muſt be taken away, that he may never ſee the glory of God; but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 47.</note> as man, <hi>Vt homines videant,</hi> that men might ſee the Iudge of men. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quamvis non recedat pater à filio, unum enim ſunt, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ad iudicium veniet filius, non Pater:</hi> although the Father depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not from the Sonne, (for they are one) yet the Sonne ſhall come to iudgement, and not the Father<hi>: Quia ibi nec Deitas Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij, nec Patris videbitur,</hi> for there neither the Deity of the Father, nor of the Sonne ſhall be ſeene.</p>
               <p>The third thing to bee handled, is the <hi>manner of his comming to iudgement;</hi> it will be a moſt fearefull, yet a glorious comming; he will come with thouſands of his Saints: For if other Benches be furniſhed with Iuſtices of Peace, Gods Bench ſhall bee furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Angels: <hi>Thouſand thouſands ſhall miniſter unto him, and tenne thouſand thouſand ſhall ſtand before him,</hi> and when hee ſhall thus come in his glory, <hi>fulminabit è Coelo,</hi> the Lord will thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Heauen; and the higheſt will give his voyce. Now if the thunder and and crackling of a cloud be ſo terrible; what terror ſhall there be, when hee ſhall thunder, that ſitteth above the clouds? The thunder doth but demoliſh Mountaines, and roote up trees; but when God ſhall thunder out his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hee will cruſh and caſt downe King, Prince, and People, that have not made him their fortreſſe, and their tower. The thunder doth but ſhake the clouds, &amp; make them to flye up and downe; as birds in the ayre: but when God ſhall thunder out his judgements, hee will ſhake and aſtoniſh the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Yet ſhall there bee then a great difference betwixt a good and a guilty conſcience; for a good conſcience ſhall bee moved, <hi>ſed ut folium,</hi> but as a leafe, with a little winde and breath of Gods diſpleaſure, but the guilty ſhall bee removed, as the foundations of the Earth are ſhaken with the full rigour of Gods wrath: For then, as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> hath it, <hi>Terra tremet, mare mugiet,</hi> the Earth ſhall quake, the Sea roare, the Ayre ring, the World burne; And all this all becommeth as a fire-brand or burning coale.</p>

If <hi>Adam</hi> for the commiſſion of one ſinne, ranne from God in great feare, and hidde himſelfe among the trees that were in the garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. whither ſhalt thou runne, ô ſinnefull <hi>Adamite,</hi> that haſt committed as many ſinnes, as ſtarres in the sky, or ſands by the ſea? <hi>Imo horum numerus numero non clauditur ullo;</hi> Yea the number of them is not to be numbred. Whither, I ſay, wilt thou run, or where ſhalt thou hide thy ſelfe from this terrible Iudge? If the drowning of the old World, the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the earth to ſwallow up <hi>Corah, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like the Iudgements have ſuch horrour in them; who can expreſſe the horrour of this day? when many millions of wicked ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hell, with all the people that forget God? If it be ſuch a ſhame to doe penance for one fault in one congregation, where men will pray for the offendour, what a ſhame will it be, when all our faults ſhall bee diſcovered before all the whole world, without all hope of pitty and help, and all workers of iniquity ſhall be caſt alive into that lake, that burneth with fire and brimſtone? Looke therefore to your ſelves, yee generation of Vipers, and waſh your hands, and clenſe your hearts: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Iudge of all the world will doe right.</p>
               <p>2. This doctrine of Iudgement ſerveth for <hi>comfort</hi> to all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Chriſtians, they may lift up their heads, &amp; rejoice with joy unſpeakable and glorious: <hi>For the Lord ſhall then come, &amp; be glorified</hi>

He is thy brother, and carries a moſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection unto thee: and will he condemne his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? He is thy head, and hath performed all the offices of an head unto thee: and can he then faile thee, when thou haſt moſt need of him? hee died for us, to redeeme us, a people peculiar unto himſelfe; and will he faile us in the laſt act of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Oh no, no, lift up your heads then, and in patience poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe your ſoules: What though hee bee terrible to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? to thee hee will bee kind and mercifull: thou ſhalt not bee wronged by falſe witneſſes, neither ſhalt thou bee iudged by common fame, or outward appearance. The Iudge will not be tranſported either by paſſion or ſpleene, nor will condemne thee, to ſatisfy the people, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did <hi>Ieſus:</hi> and beſides, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be remembred, but what good thou haſt wrought and done; thy ſinnes ſhall be cleane blotted out of remembrance; they ſhall bee buried in the heart of the earth, and drowned in the bottome of the ſea; they ſhall never riſe up to Iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. Rejoice therefore, poore penitent, thou ſhalt find Chriſt a friend, no foe; a Ieſus, no Iudge; a Saviour, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder: thou ſhalt find Heaven, and not Hell; Angels, not Divels; Gods right hand, not his left hand; everlaſting life, and not everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>3. This doctrine of judgement ſerveth for <hi>inſtruction:</hi> Firſt, it ſhould reſtraine uncharitable cenſuring, and judging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? hee ſtandeth or falleth to his maſter.</hi> Chriſt is the Lord of quicke and dead: Iudge therefore nothing before the time. If wee could conſider, that <hi>we ſhould every one give accompt to God himſelfe,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12. wee ſhould find worke enough, to looke to our owne ſcore, and little leaſure to foreſtall God in this matter of judging.</p>
               <p>2. Are there matters of difference among us? Let the Saints judge them, and end them. God will bee contented to put his cauſe to them at the laſt day; <hi>For we know that the Saints ſhall judge</hi>

                  <hi>the World:</hi> and therefore why ſhould we refuſe their arbitrement?</p>
               <p>3. It ſhould order and moderate our ſorrowes for our dead friends; <hi>We ſhould not ſorrow, as people without hope, ſeeing we beleeve, that all that ſleepe in Ieſus, God will bring with him,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 17, 18. we ſhall meet together againe in that day, and ever live together with the Lord; and therefore wee ſhould comfort one another with theſe words.</p>
               <p>4. This ſummons to judgement gives a dreadfull warning, &amp;
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:15606:180"/>
admonition to the world, even to all men every where to repent; <note place="margin">We ſhould prevent iudgement, by iudging our ſelves.</note> in ſo much as God hath appointed a day, <hi>wherein he will judge the world with righteouſneſſe, by that Man whom he hath appointed: Act.</hi> 17. 31. Woe will bee unto us, if that day come upon us unawares, before we have made our peace, and humbled our ſelves before God, and by true repentance turne from ſinne, to ſanctity. It is an unſpeable favour, that God ſhewes us, when he offers us this mercy, that <hi>if we judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged of the Lord in that day,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 34. And it will on the other ſide kindle his wrath extremely, when having ſuch grace offered, wee neglect it, and death, and judgement find our ſinnes unremitted on Gods part, and unrepented of ours.</p>
               <p>5. Seeing that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, it ſhould ſtirre us up to an holy converſation: So reaſoneth S. <hi>Peter, Seeing that all thoſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner perſons ought we to be in holy converſation and godlineſſe, looking for and haſting to the comming of the day of God, &amp;c?</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, 12. We are Gods ſtewards, let us arme our ſelves, as they that muſt give accounts of their ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip, and let us jmploy ſuch talents, as God hath lent us, to Gods glory, and our neighbours good.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſince the day of Iudgement is the day of our full and finall Redemption; and ſince hee ſhall come as a theefe in the night, even the houre that we thinke not; Let us therefore watch and be ready, alwayes carefull and diligent, ſighing and groning, longing and praying, haſting to, and looking for this glorious comming of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt to judgement.</p>

               <p>Againe, God having given them bread and fleſh, no ſooner wanted they water, but they were as vile: <hi>Wherefore the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Moſes and ſaid, Give us water, that wee may drinke; and the people murmured againſt Moſes, and ſaid, Wherefore haſt thou brought us out of Aegypt, to kill us, and our children, and our cattell with thirſt?</hi> Thus like dogges, except their mouthes were filled, they barked continually, like the Gangrene or the diſeaſe called the Woolfe, which gnaweth ever except it be fed: For no ſooner had God delivered them out of Aegypt, but except he would deliver them from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo, they would raile.

Cyrill</hi> noteth upon the 6. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Verſ. 52. that this ſinne of murmuring is hereditary to the Iewes; it was <hi>morbus haereditarius</hi> (like the ſtone) the Fathers conveyed it ever to their children, and this ſinne like the heads of <hi>Hydra,</hi> drew many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes after it, as diſobedience, ingratitude, impatience, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, tempting of God, blaſphemy; it was never alone.</p>

               <p>And the only way to repreſſe this murmuring and repining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; is firſt to conſider the providence of God, ruling all things in heaven and in earth, and overſwaying all creatures, that nothing falleth out without his will and pleaſure, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth; <hi>Are not two ſparrowes ſold for a farthing, and one of</hi>

Who feedeth the yong Ravens, <note place="margin">Earthly things will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection bee heavenly.</note> that cry unto him? Who ſuſtaineth the wicked, that are his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Who provideth all things for man in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was made, and created? Is it not the Lord, whoſe all the beaſts of the forreſt are, and the cattell upon a thouſand moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines? Let us then never murmure, but reſt upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and he will feed us, and cloath us, and care for us.</p>
               <p>A ſecond remedy to repreſſe this murmuring, is to roote out all diſtruſtfull cares, and to bee content with ſuch things as wee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.</note> have already, and to beare with patience, whatſoever the Lord ſendeth. This mind was in <hi>Iacob,</hi> in his journey he did not deſire ſilver and gold, houſe, or lands, but only a competent and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient living: <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me in my journey which I goe, and will give me bread to eate, and cloathes to put on, then ſhall the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The laſt remedy to keep us from murmuring, is, to ſet our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon Heavenly things, and not upon earthly. If wee doe beleeve that God doth forbeare, and forgive us our ſinnes, and not deale with us according to our deſervings; if he ſanctify us with his ſpirit, and make our bodies, temples of the Holy Ghoſt; if he turne us unto himſelfe, working our converſion, which is as great a worke, as at the firſt to create us; we may bee well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he will deliver our ſoules from death, and preſerve us from famine<hi>: For if he ſpared not his owne Sonne, but hath given him</hi>

               <p>There is murmuring alſo againſt man, grudging either at their wealth, or at their love and favour, or at the credit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, wherein they goe before other men. So the Phariſes
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:15606:183"/>
murmured againſt Ieſus, and againſt his Diſciples, becauſe the <note place="margin">One man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily againſt another.</note> people followed them: and thus the Grecians murmured againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, becauſe their widowes were neglected in their daily miniſtring; a fault whether more bad, or common <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1.</note> among us, it is hard to ſay: For what more ordinary among men than murmuring? If he be our ſuperiour in wealth, or in honour, or in credit, wee murmure againſt him, as too great to dwell ſo neere us; and if he bee our equall, wee grudge that hee ſhould thrive and proſper aſwell as wee; if he be our inferiour, wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine him. Thus among all ſorts there is murmuring: ſo that whereas all things ſhould bee done without murmuring, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done without murmuring: one man repines againſt another: We ſay, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, what ſhall this man doe?</hi> We grudge like the men of the vineyard: <hi>Nemo ſua ſorte contentus:</hi>

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9.</note> frame our lives to Gods Word, and not <hi>walke after our owne luſts.</hi> It is true in yong &amp; old, and in all men; <hi>Verbum, ut Sara: voluntas,</hi>

                  <hi>They ſpeake proud things.]</hi> To ſpeake things, hath beene a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſinne from the beginning of the primitive Church, to this day; like <hi>Noahs</hi> deluge, it hath overflowed, and like another <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> conquered: it was in the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the roote of their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy; For <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> their Prince, as ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Sonne of God, the power of God, and under <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour his Image was ſet up, and worſhipped as God; after him came <hi>Menander,</hi> and ſpake proud things, affirming, that he was ſent a Saviour from inviſible things, for the ſalvation of the world. After him, <hi>Apelles, Montanus, Manes,</hi> which affirmed that they were ſent by the Holy Ghoſt: ſuch in our time were <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus men now ſwell in pride, in opinion, in words, in deeds, in all things. <hi>Hagar</hi> waxeth proud againſt her dame <hi>Sara. Aeſops</hi> crow jetteth in the plumes and feathers of other birds; and the <hi>Cumane Aſſe</hi> walketh up and downe with his long eares, in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons skinne: For commonly none are prouder, then the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt: As the Holy Ghoſt noteth of the bramble; who would be King over the trees, when as the figge-tree, the olive-tree, and the vine-tree refuſed it; For the figge-tree would not leave his ſweetneſſe, nor the olive-tree her fatneſſe, nor the vine her wine, wherewith ſhee did cheare the heart both of God and man, to rule over the trees: only the ſcratching bramble, he was ſo proud, that he would. <hi>Pan</hi> will compare with <hi>Apollo; Arachne,</hi> with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva; Silenus</hi> with <hi>Mercury, Phaëton</hi> will manage his fathers teame; <hi>Icarus</hi> will mount up with his wings of waxe; the Fly <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalla</hi> will ſport with the candle; the Phariſe will ſay, there is no ſinner like the Publican. The Laodicians will boaſt of their wealth, knowledge, and all graces. The yong man will ſay that he hath kept all the precepts of God; <hi>Naminania dolia acutiſſimè reſonant,</hi> the emptieſt tubbes make the greateſt ſound. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries boxes, which have nothing in them, are beſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the bramble was burned, <hi>Phaëton</hi> ſpoiled the frame of the world; <hi>Icarus</hi> wings melted; the Fly is burnt in the flame; the Phariſe went home unjuſtified; the Laodicians were throwne downe to hell, the yong man went away ſorrowfull. <hi>God will humble the proud;</hi> Let every man therefore thinke better of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then of himſelfe. But we forget, that <hi>ſequitur ſuperbos ultor è tergo Deus,</hi> that God followeth the proud man at the heeles, to plague him and puniſh him; nay, wee forget, that we are men, and weake men, and ſo our pride groweth to be infinite. <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond would make no water, but in ſilver baſons; <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi> would avoid no excrements, but in veſſels of gold; <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi> would eate no meate, but Nightingales tongues; <hi>Sapor,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> would uſe no footſtoole, but the necke of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Valerian; in Arabia foelix,</hi> the Nobles would kindle no fire, but of Cinamon; the grand <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartaria</hi> will not be drawne of horſes, but of Elephants: our pride is infinit, our words, our deeds, our thoughts Majeſticall. <hi>Sed quid ſuperbis terra &amp; cinis?</hi> Why art thou proud, duſt and aſhes? And yet this proud man catcheth nothing but ſmoke, and gaineth nothing but ſmoke. We marvell at the Emperour, who paſſed all his feſtivall daies in killing of flies; but how much more may we marvell at him, who paſſeth all his dayes in catching of ſmoke, and the blaſt of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:15606:191"/>
mens mouthes. A certaine King therefore appointed this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <note place="margin">Flatterers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud others, to enrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> for proud men, that they ſhould bee ſuffocated, and choaked with ſmoke, ſaying, that it was right and meet, that they ſhould periſh in ſmoke, which have ſpent their whole life in catching the ſmoke of vanity and vaine-glory.</p>
               <p>The end of all this clawing, is gaine: men ſpeake for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they have ſugred tongues, oyled mouthes, dulced words: but ſuſpect them, for they ſpeake for gaine; like <hi>Aeſops-Foxe,</hi> that telleth the Crow, that ſhe was the faireſt bird in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, if ſhe could ſing: and therewithall ſhe opened her mouth to ſing, but ſhe loſt her meate by it. Thus the flatterer aimeth at advantage, at gaine, at profit; he maketh a ſhew he is thy friend, and wiſheth thee well; but he is but a verball friend, a friend from teeth outward, a flattering friend, a friend in ſhew, but not in deed; like <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> fallacions; and falling ſtarres, which ſeeme to be, and are not, a friend only in name, one that will give thee his hand, but not the heart; for he hath a tongue to commend thee, but yet no longer, then it is for his advantage; like <hi>Hiena,</hi> he hath a faire face, but a falſe heart, like <hi>Iael,</hi> to <hi>Siſera.</hi> We read in <hi>Theognis</hi> this ſaying, Seeme with thy tongue to flatter all, but in thy deeds love none at all. O theſe flatterers, they are <hi>lucritam cupidi,</hi> ſo greedy of gaine, that they have <hi>animam venalem,</hi> a ſoule to ſell: for <hi>quid non mortalia pectora cogit auri ſacra fames?</hi> What doth not the curſed hunger of gold drive men to doe? This ſets them aworke to flatter, lie, ſweare, and forſweare, and what not? <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith of the harlot, that <hi>ſhe will not leave a man worth a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of bread;</hi> no more will theſe flatterers, they will ſoake, and ſucke men, as the <hi>Ivie</hi> doth the Oake, and bring them at laſt into our Ladies bands, and make them ſing by beggery. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sicut finis oratoris eſt, dilectione perſuaſiſſe; &amp; medici, medicina curaſſe; ſic adulatoris eſt, ſuavi loquio ſe ditaſſe;</hi> As the end of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour is to perſwade in loue, and the end of a Phyſician, to cure by medicine; ſo the end of the flatterer is, with his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hony-ſugar-candy ſpeeches to inrich himſelfe and begger thee, and the end of his clawing is gaine, advantage. I will conclude with the ſaying of Auguſtine, <hi>Melius eſt a quolibet reprehendi, quàm ab adulante laudari,</hi> It is better to bee blamed of any, then praiſed of a flatterer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being asked, What was the firſt, ſecond, and third part of a good man, of a Chriſtian? anſwered, Humility: ſo if I were asked, What were the firſt, ſecond, and third part of a vile man? I will anſwere, Pride: and he hath pride, <hi>whoſe mouth ſpeaketh proud things.</hi> And of all mouthes, let the Popiſh mouthes goe in the quinteſſence of pride and bragging<hi>:</hi> they ſpeake of merits, workes of Iuſtification, and ſupererogation, enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their neighbours, wherein they injure both the Iuſtice &amp; Mercy of God; for his Iuſtice cannot be perfect, if he take for

But to proceed; <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7.</note> the Canoniſts ſay, that <hi>Papa poteſt diſpenſare contra jus divinum, jus naturae, contra Apoſtolos, contra omnia praecepta Dei:</hi> The Pope can diſpenſe againſt the Law Divine, the Law of Nature, againſt the Apoſtles, againſt all the Commandements of God. Let God, men, and Angels judge, what mouth now ſpeaketh proudly. The great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> after he hath dined, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a trumpet, and giveth leave to all Chriſtian Princes to goe to dinner, and by this prety conceit maketh himſelfe head over Kings and Emperours: becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ecce, hîc ſunt duo gladij,</hi> Behold, here are two ſwords. Thus this Italian Prieſt is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called, <hi>Dominus Deus noſter Papa,</hi> our Lord God the Pope; to be kneeled unto, with theſe words<hi>: Agnus Dei, qui tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis peccata mundi, miſerere nobis:</hi> Lambe of God, that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, have mercy upon us.

               <p>But to leave the man of ſinne himſelfe, and to come to the frogges that creep out of his mouth; what a croking doe they make? How doe their mouthes exceed in pride? <hi>Staphilus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth our people, hogges, dogges; <hi>Harding</hi> calleth our Biſhops

Thus they diſgrace us in words, and their mouthes ſpeake proud, ſwelling things; when they cannot confute us, they raile on us, and deale with us, as <hi>Nero</hi> dealt with the Chriſtians, who hurled them to dogs to be devoured; and when the maſtives would not touch them, he clad the Chriſtians in Beares skinnes, to kindle the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the dogs, that they might take them to bee beaſts, and not men: ſo they impute all lewdneſſe to us, to make men thinke that we are that which we are not: they are like the beaſt <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who having his hornes reflexed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to defend himſelfe with them, three or foure furlongs off poyſoneth the dogges with his dung; which is ſo hot, as it burneth off all their haire. So, when they cannot hurt us with truth, they defile us with the durt and dung of their calumnies: this veine of railing cleaveth unto them, as <hi>Naamans</hi> Ieproſie did to <hi>Gehezi,</hi> and his ſeed for ever: they are of the mind of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> paraſiteto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who willed his Schollers ever to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their enemies; <hi>Nam ſi vulnus (inquit) ſanaverint, manet tamen cicatrix;</hi> for although they have healed the wound, the ſcarre of the ſlander abideth ſtill. So, ſome will beleeve them, they leave ſtill a ſting behind them, they thinke much, that we ſhould ſay thus much, and therefore call our Apologies, railings.

               <p>For the firſt, all ſinners are to be rebuked, yet with wiſdome and diſcretion; <hi>Qui mittit in altum lapidem, recidet in caput ejus,</hi> leſt he deale like a man that throweth up a ſtone raſhly in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and it fall downe againe upon his owne head; to teach him wiſdome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the time muſt bee, while phyſicke may doe good; <hi>Nullum medicamentum ſanat, niſi quod opportunè adhibueris,</hi> No ſalve is ſaving that is miniſtred out of ſeaſon<hi>:</hi> it is too late for birds to build their neſts in ſummer; for the husbandman to ſow in harveſt; for the mariner to goe to ſea, when the ſhippe is under ſaile; for the gardiner to diſplant trees, when they be old; for a ſicke man to goe to phyſicke, when he is a dying; for the cooke to ſeaſon meate that is putrified; for the vine-dreſſer to gather fruit when they bee rotten; for a man to caſt water, when the houſe is burnt; and for the groome of the ſtable to ſhut the dore when the Steed is ſtollen: but the bird builds her neſt in the Spring, the husbandman ſoweth his ſeed in Autumne, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner goeth to ſea, when the ſhippe is in the Haven, a wiſe man <hi>ante languorem,</hi> before ſickneſſe goeth to phyſicke, the gardinet planteth trees when they are yong, the cooke ſeaſoneth his meate before it bee tainted, and a wiſe man caſteth water, when the houſe beginneth to ſmoke; &amp; reproofes muſt be uſed, while the ſinner is curable.</p>

whereas a curriſh ſpirit wil be too too angry, becauſe he is rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <note place="margin">Malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenders condemned.</note> Now the end of all our reprovings muſt be, to bring the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reproved to repentance: This was S. <hi>Peters</hi> end, in rebuking <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> end, in excommunicating the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">

               <p>And here I am to deale with three ſorts of men: our covetous, ambitious and malicious reprehenders.</p>
               <p>Our covetous will barke with the dogge, cackle with the daw, and ſing with the crow for gaine; while there is hope of a prey; but deale as the Fox did with the crow, make fruſtrate their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous hope, ſay and do what yee will, yee ſhall not have aword <note place="margin">Aeſope.</note> of them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, are like <hi>Pierius</hi> ambitious daughters, that were turned into Magpies, for correcting the Muſes; theſe will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <note place="margin">Ovid Metam.</note> Rulers, to winne applauſe of the Commons; propound Chriſt for an example, but their end is vaineglory.</p>

               <p>The ſecond ſort of mocking, is <hi>Irriſio hominum,</hi> mocking of men, but the diſgrace alights on God, for as the defacing of the image is the diſgrace of the Prince: ſo the mocking of a Chriſtian, is the ſcorning of Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> was diſhonoured in the diſgrace of his ſervants, and Chriſt derided in the deriſion <note place="margin">

               <p>This teacheth us two things, firſt, that all Chriſtians ſhould bee edifiers, builders, that is, ſhould make themſelves a ſeemely houſe for God to dwell in. Wee read what care <hi>David</hi> had to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:15606:217"/>
build a Temple; but God would not ſuffer him: but now every man muſt build a Temple for God, even his own ſoule. We read <note place="margin">The Word of God muſt be the ſquare wherewith we muſt build.</note> what coſt <hi>Salomon</hi> beſtowed upon the Temple: but now God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for ſuch Temples made of ſtone, he will have a Temple made of lively ſtones: For howſoever Heaven is his ſeate, and the Earth his foot-ſtole, yet his moſt principall &amp; princely palace of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. 1, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</note> pleaſure is mans heart: hereupon ſaith a father, <hi>Quàm excelſus es, Domine, &amp; humiles corde ſunt domus tuae!</hi> O how high &amp; how Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne art thou, O Lord! yet the humble-hearted are the houſes wherein thou dwelleſt: For as the Lord loved the gates of <hi>Sion,</hi> more than all the dwellings of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo hee loveth a faithfull heart, a devout ſoule, more than all the pavillions of Princes.</p>
               <p>All true Chriſtians muſt bee builders; therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Let all bee to edification,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 27. but before they build, they <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 27.</note> muſt know how to build; and the way to come to this knowledge is the Scripture. No Carpenter will build an houſe without rule and ſquare, and the rule and ſquare of Chriſtian building is the Word of God; by it our hearts and ſoules are ſquared, and made fit for Gods houſe: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taking his leave of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, commendeth them to God and to the</hi>

Without the knowledge of the Scripture, wee can no more edifie and build, than a Carpenter can build without tooles, or a Mariner ſaile without his compaſſe, or a bird flye without his feathers: it is the Word of God that is able to make the man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: it is that that will make him become a fit houſe, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Lord: Of this building Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Yee are come to the Lord Ieſus, as a living ſtone, reiected of men, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and choſen of God: wherefore you your ſelves bee built as lively</hi>

               <p>In every good worke three things are to be conſidered.</p>

                  <hi>Origo, Finis, Vſus,</hi> The beginning. The end, and Vſe.</p>
               <p>The originall or beginning of every good worke is faith: faith is as the Mother, and the holy Ghoſt the Father of all good workes: Faith begetteth Love, and Love bloſſometh forth in Vertue, and Vertue buddeth foorth in good Workes: whereupon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> inferreth this exhortation, <hi>Ioyne moreover Vertue with your Faith, and with Vertue, Knowledge, and with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the end is the glory of God; Hereupon ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatſoever yee doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, the uſe is manifold: Firſt, they are unto us ſignes of our election; and therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would have us to <hi>make our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; calling ſure</hi> by them.

                  <hi>Ezechias</hi> prayer, was the whole hoſt of <hi>Senacherib</hi> overthrowne: one faithfull mans prayer, is more forcible than the power of an whole army. Witnes the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who lift up his hands, <note place="margin">

               <p>Many admirable and extraordinary things have Gods children in all ages effected by prayer. By prayer, <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for <hi>Iſmael;</hi> by prayer, <hi>Moſes</hi> divided the red ſea; by prayer,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:15606:225"/>
                  <hi>Ioſhua</hi> made the Sunne to ſtand ſtill in the middeſt of heaven; by <note place="margin">Prayer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to God and man.</note> prayer, <hi>Anna</hi> became fertile; by prayer, <hi>Ezechias</hi> procured a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger life; by prayer, <hi>Iudith</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Holofernes;</hi> and <hi>Eſter</hi> ſaveth the Iewes; by prayer, <hi>Suſanna</hi> is ſaved from the unjuſt Iudges; <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lions, and <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Herod;</hi> by prayer, the Leper is cured, the Publican juſtified, the Divels ſcared, Heaven gates opened, the fetters looſed, and iniquity vanquiſhed; by prayer, wee have acceſſe unto the throne of grace; It is a great bleſſing, that God in his Word vouchſafeth to ſpeake to man, but not comparable to this, that man ſhould talke with God. Yee ſee the power of prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, prayer is a pleaſant thing, to God and man.</p>
               <p>To God, and therefore reſembled to the incenſe, <hi>Let my prayer come forth as the incenſe, and let the lifting up of my hands bee an evening</hi>

                  <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> For as the ſent of incenſe is pleaſant to the noſthrils of man, ſo are the prayers of the Saints unto God: for when they <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> aſcend to heaven, God ſeemeth to ſmell a ſweet ſavour like the incenſe.</p>
               <p>Prayer alſo is pleaſant, and delightfull unto man; For if it were a pleaſure to <hi>Iacob,</hi> for to ſpeake to <hi>Rachel,</hi> and to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> with <hi>David;</hi> what a pleaſure is it for a devour ſoule to ſpeake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? <hi>Oratio locutio eſt ad Deum, quando legis, Deus tibi loquitur: quando oras, cum Deo loqueris:</hi> Prayer is a ſpeaking to God; when <note place="margin">Aug.</note> thou readeſt, God ſpeakes to thee; when thou prayeſt, thou tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt with God. The child is never better, then when it is in the fathers or mothers lappe: ſo we ſhall never be better, then when by prayer we creep (as it were) into our Heavenly Fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>And thus wee ſee the profit, power, and pleaſure of prayer: the experience of this hath made good men to ſpend their dayes in prayer. <hi>David</hi> roſe at midnight to pray; <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed three <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>Hiſt. tripart.</hi>
                  </note> times a day: It is reported of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> that his knees were horne-hoofed with prayer; and <hi>Nazianzene</hi> writeth of his ſiſter <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> that ſhee was ſo given to prayer, that her knees ſeemed to cleave to the earth, by reaſon of her continuall kneeling at prayer; and <hi>Gregory</hi> in his dialogues writeth of his Aunt <hi>Traſilla,</hi> being dead, that ſhee was found to have her elbowes as hard as hornes, which hardneſſe ſhe got by leaning to a deske, at which ſhee uſed to pray: and Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> writing of <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite, affirmeth, that hee was found dead, kneeling upon his knees, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his hands, and lifting up his eyes; ſo that the very dead corps ſeemed yet to live, and by a kind of religious geſture to pray ſtill to God. The Iewes beganne the day, and ended it with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.</note> prayer. It is ſaid of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Hermite, that having ſpent the whole night in prayer, hee chid the Sunne at the riſing of it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O Sol, mimis properè nobis redijsti;</hi> O Sunne, thou haſt returned
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:15606:225"/>
to us over-ſoone; I am troubled with thy light, the greatneſſe of <note place="margin">Divers kinds of prayer, in reſpect of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> thy light hindreth mee from contemplation, and the light of my God; and of <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> that hee paſſed twelve dayes and nights in contemplation; <hi>pavimentum erat lectus,</hi> the pavement was his bed, water his drinke, barly his bread, and rootes his dainties. If we compare with theſe men, we ſhall be found like the <hi>Pigmaei,</hi> in reſpect of the great Giants. Wee be not men of prayer, wee riſe in the morning, as the wild Aſſe to his prey, and we lie downe at night, as dogges do in their kennell: The <hi>Euchites</hi> pray too much, wee too little, or not at all; the Papiſts prayed in the night, but wee neither day nor night.</p>
               <p>But of prayer in reſpect of the matter there bee divers kindes: <hi>Petition. Deprecation. Interceſſion. Expoſtulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petition,</hi> is for good things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deprecation,</hi> to remove evill things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> for others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> againſt others.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> devideth prayer into <hi>Supplications. Prayers. Interceſsions.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Thankeſgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Supplications,</hi> are for the removing of evill, whether it bee <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum culpae,</hi> or <hi>Malum poenae;</hi> the evill of ſinne, or the evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayers,</hi> are for the obtayning of good, for <hi>God will give good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>things to them that aske of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Interceſsions,</hi> are in the behalfe of others; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the people, ſaying, <hi>Forgive them, or els race mee out of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thankeſgivings,</hi> are for benefits received. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And theſe foure, the Apoſtle referreth in another place to two heads. 1. <hi>Requeſts,</hi> 2. <hi>Thankeſgiving.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Vnder requeſt, hee comprehendeth ſupplication, prayer, and interceſſion.</p>
               <p>But the moſt uſuall diſtinction is grounded on 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17, 18. which is, <hi>Petition,</hi> and <hi>Thankeſgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in all theſe kindes of prayer, a Chriſtian muſt be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and uſe them as occaſion ſerves: and thus yee ſee the diſtinct kindes of prayer in reſpect of the matter.</p>
               <p>There are other diſtinctions in regard of the manner, the firſt <hi>Mentall</hi> and <hi>Vocall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mentall,</hi> is an inward lifting up of the heart to God, without any outward manifeſtation of the ſame by word; ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:15606:226"/>
was, when God ſaid unto him, <hi>Why cryeſt thou to me?</hi> yet hee ſpake <note place="margin">Prayer divers in reſpect of the manner.</note> never a word with his tongue, onely he ſighed and groned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vocall</hi> is that which is uttered with words, as was the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.</note> when hee cried, <hi>God be mercifull unto me a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A prayer in regard of the manner of it, is <hi>Sudden,</hi> or <hi>Compoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sudden,</hi> when as upon ſome occaſion the heart is lifted up to God either by ſighing or ſpeaking; ſuch as was <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nehe.</hi> 2. 4.</note> and theſe are called the ejaculations of the heart, which (as one ſaith) are to bee uſed as ſalt with meate; with every bit of meate wee commonly take a little ſalt to ſeaſon it; ſo when wee doe any thing, we muſt lift up our hearts to God, and ſeaſon our buſines by prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Compoſed</hi> prayer, is the powring forth of ſome ſolemne prayer to God, privately by our ſelves: and ſuch were the prayers that <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed to make three times a day. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, prayer is either <hi>Conceived</hi> or <hi>Preſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conceived</hi> prayer is that, which hee who uttereth the prayer, inventeth and conceiveth of himſelfe; and ſuch are moſt of the prayers recorded in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preſcribed</hi> is, when a ſet conſtant forme of prayer is layed downe before-hand; a thing very frequent in the Scriptures: in <hi>Numbers</hi> God preſcribed a ſet forme of bleſſing for the Prieſts continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23, 24.</note> to uſe: and the 92. <hi>Pſalme</hi> was preſcribed, <hi>A ſong for the Sabbath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>day;</hi> and Chriſt himſelfe preſcribed an excellent forme of prayer; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves a ſet forme of bleſſing in the beginning and end of his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, prayer is either <hi>Publike</hi> or <hi>Private.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publike,</hi> when a whole Congregation with one joint conſent call upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Private</hi> is that, which is made by ſome few together, as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4. 33.</note> and his ſervant were alone in a chamber praying for the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> child; or when a man prayeth by himſelfe alone, as did <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius:</hi> and of this kinde of prayer Chriſt ſpeaketh thus, <hi>When thou</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>prayeſt, enter into thy chamber, and ſhut the dore, and pray to thy Father in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe prayers muſt wee ſend up to God in the mediation of Chriſt: <hi>Nam quid dulcius quàm Genitorem in nomine Vnigeniti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocare?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aug.</note> What is ſweeter, then to call upon the Father in the name of his onely begotten Sonne? And they muſt bee powred out with feare and reverence: Our hearts muſt bee raiſed from the dunghill of the earth, to the glorious Throne of Heaven, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let our hearts be lifted up.</hi> Our geſtures muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and humble, and kneeling is the fitteſt geſture in prayer: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 41.</note> and they muſt bee delivered with fervency, <hi>For the prayer of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.</note>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:15606:226"/>
                  <hi>the righteous avayleth much, if it bee fervent.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prayer is for all times and all things.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yea in prayer wee muſt bee diligent; <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to pray alwayes, nay <hi>indeſinenter orare,</hi> to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing: but if any man ſay, they cannot ſpend ſo much time <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17.</note> in prayer, they have other things to attend: I anſwere, that prayer hindereth no labour, it is <hi>opus animi, non corporis,</hi> a worke of the mind, not of the body: for why, the husband-man at the plough, the pilot at the helme, the mariner at the oares, the coblar at his Laſt, the weaver at his Loomes, the woman at her rock may pray, and yet loſe no time; the heart may bee occupied as was <hi>Moſes</hi> heart at the red Sea. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calleth Chriſtians Bees, that have <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.</note> wax in their hands, their clawes: to note their worke, and hony in their mouthes, that is Hymnes, Pſalmes, prayers to glorify God; as is ſaid of the Primitive Church, <hi>Theſe all continued with one accord in prayer and ſupplication, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One calleth prayers, Gods Graſhoppers, Gods Nightingales, <note place="margin">Onuphrius.</note> who praiſe him in the day, and pray in the night: and good men <hi>will pray alway with all manner of prayers and ſupplications in the ſpirit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.</note>

Thus our love ſhould be holy, juſt, true, conſtant: this is true Chriſtian love, wherein men ſhould keep themſelves; For among murtherers, theeves, and drunkards, there is a kind of love, but not the Love that <hi>Iude</hi> would here to bee among us.

One ſaith, that love is like hony in bitter broth, and ſugar in ſowre wine; it is like unto the Sun unto the world, a candle unto the houſe, a light for our journey, a line for our life, and a rule for our reprehenſions. <hi>Si diligis, fac quicquid vis:</hi> If <note place="margin">Calvin in Iohn.

                  <hi>Keep your ſelves in the Love of God.</hi> And firſt, of Gods Love tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards us; next, of our love towards God: but in ſpeaking of the Love of God to us, I ſhall enter into a labyrinth without end, into a ſea without bottome: For his Love is ſo much, as there is no affection in nature, no proportion in the whole world hath been found fit to expreſſe it; the height of heaven above the earth, the diſtance of the Eaſt from the Weſt, the affection of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers towards their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; of mothers towards the fruit of their wombe; of nurſes towards their ſucklings; of Eagles towards their yong ones, of hennes towards their chickens; all theſe are but the ſhadowes of Gods Love.

               <p>And God hath an immanent Love in him, whereby he loveth himſelfe, by the neceſſity of his owne nature; and hath a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent love flowing from him, whereby hee loveth his creatures, ſome more and ſome leſſe: according to the liberty of his owne will.</p>
               <p>He hath a generall Love to all. For all are his creatures and the workemanſhip of his hands: but hee hath a ſpeciall Love to ſome, as unto his Elect and choſen, and his Love towards them is both Temporary, and Sempiternall.</p>

               <p>And now to ſpeake of our love to God; and that the love whereby wee love God, is a worke of Gods Love, whereby hee loves man. <hi>Cauſa diligendi Deum, Deus est, modus ſine modo:</hi> The <note place="margin">Bern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> cauſe that wee love God, is God himſelfe, the meaſure without meaſure. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>We loved him, becauſe hee loved us firſt:</hi> For our love ſprings out of his; as the rivers from the Sea, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 19.</note> his Love drawing our hearts to him, as the Loadſtone doth iron to it; or as the Sardius doth wood, our love anſwering to his Love, as an Eccho to a mans voice: and as one candle doth light another, ſo the conſideration of his Love to us, doth cauſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of our love to him.</p>
               <p>And there bee many reaſons to move us to keep our ſelves in the Love of God: The firſt is his Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>love the Lord thy God;</hi> And againe, <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare and love him?</hi> This our Saviour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>The great Commandement.</hi> The Commander is great, the Object is great, the uſe of the duty is great, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is great, that take care to doe it: and though there were no other reaſon to move us to love God, but his bare Commandement, yet were that reaſon ſtrong enough to bind us; the power of a King, the authority of a Father, the place of a maſter, requireth obedience of a ſubject, child, and ſervant; but God is our King, our Father, and Maſter,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:15606:235"/>
and therefore his bare command is ſufficient to bind us to love <note place="margin">We muſt love God, becauſe he commands it, and equity requires it.</note> him.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon, to move us to keep our ſelves in the Love of God, is in regard of equity: For ſeeing Almighty God doth love us, it is a matter of equity, that wee ſhould requite love with love againe. For though wee cannot love him as wee ought, and as hee loveth us; yet muſt wee love, for ours is an aſcending, his a deſcending love; and love deſcending, is more naturall, more fervent and vehement, than love aſcending; as wee ſee in parents, who love their children better, then their children love them: beſides, God loved us, when wee were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: <note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, Commodity ſhould move us to keepe our ſelves in the Love of God: For firſt, by this Love, our faith produceth thoſe good duties, which wee owe unto God. For faith is as one hand receiving love, as the other giving. <hi>For Faith worketh by</hi>

As a man by looking upon a diall, may know the motion of the Sunne in heaven; ſo by looking upon the thing hee loveth, hee may know in what eſtate hee ſtandeth; whether hee belong to <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to Hell, or Heaven, to God or the Divell.</p>
               <p>

Againe, the Love of God ingenders in us the love of the <note place="margin">We muſt love God, becauſe duty requires it.</note> godly for God: for as hee that loves the Father, cannot but love his children, and as hee that loves his friend, will not miſvſe his picture; ſo hee that truly loves God, will love Gods children which are the lively pictures of God: &amp; this love is comfortable, becauſe it aſſureth us, that <hi>wee are Chriſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by this wee know that wee are tranſlated from death to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Againe, from the Love of God ariſeth much grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as much water from one ſpring. <hi>Non habet viriditatem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus boni operis, niſi manſerit in radice charitatis:</hi> Good works wither, except they bee nouriſhed by this Love. As the love of mony is the root, and nouriſher of all evill; ſo the Love of God is the mother, and nurſe of all good, of all pious offices to God, and Chriſtian duties to man.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point: the Love of God is as ſtrong as death; for as death doth kill the body, ſo our love to God doth mortify our love to the world, and diſpels rancour, wrath, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; and as the riſing of the Sunne doth chaſe away the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night: ſo the Love of God doth drive away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love of worldly vanities: and thus yee ſee the utility of the Love of God.</p>
               <p>4. Wee ought to keep our ſelves in the Love of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is our gtacious Father, and <hi>of his owne good will begate he us, through the Word of truth.</hi> Now, if a child muſt love his father, <note place="margin">

               <p>The life of Nature is ſweete, the life of Grace ſweeter, and the life of Glory ſweeteſt of all; and this life of Glory is hid with Chriſt in God; and in this life of Glory, there ſhall bee in our bodies, firſt, <hi>Claritas,</hi> beauty and cleereneſſe, in ſo much that as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that the bodies of the Saints ſhall bee <hi>ſepties clariora Sole:</hi> ſeven times brighter than the Sunne. Secondly, in this life of Glory, there ſhall bee in our bodies ſpirituall agility: and hence is it, that ſome aſcribe the activity and quickneſſe of our ſoule &amp; ſpirit, to a glorified body, ſaying, that ſuch bodies are not ſpirits, but ſpiritualized bodies. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this life of Glory, there ſhall be in our bodies Impaſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For though here we ſuffer of every thing, yet there wee ſhall bee ſubject to no corruptible paſſion, or ſuffering. Laſtly, in this life of Glory, there ſhall bee in our bodies Immortality; here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>orimur &amp; morimur,</hi> at our byrth, wee beginne to dye, <hi>accedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> wee enter into the world, <hi>ſuccedimus,</hi> wee ſucceede one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world; and laſt of all <hi>decedimus,</hi> wee depart all out of the world; but in this life of Glory, wee ſhall have immortall bodies.</p>
               <p>And as the body, ſo the ſoule in this life of Glory ſhall bee glorified: and this her glory conſiſteth of two things; in her u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and in our viſion of God: both of theſe may be gathered out of that of Saint <hi>Iohn, When hee ſhall appeare, we ſhall bee like him, and ſee him as hee is:</hi> wee ſhall be like unto him, there <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> is our union; we ſhall ſee him as hee is, there is our viſion.

               <p>And as for the glory and happineſſe of this life, the quantity and quality may bee gathered from the ſituation of the place, for <hi>Coelum Empyreum</hi> is higher than all the Heavens: for <hi>Paul</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it <hi>the third Heaven;</hi> and it is called, <hi>The Land of the living,</hi> as if <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.</note> the Land which we now inhabit, were a Land of dead men; &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>We be dead, but our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Now, if in this <note place="margin">

In this land of the dead, behold the greatneſſe of the Heavens, the brightneſſe of the Stars, the beautie of the Earth, the plaineneſſe of the fields, the highneſſe of the Mountaines, the greatneſſe of the Vallies, the Flouds and Rivers running like, the veines in a mans body; <hi>Si omnia haec in terra mortuorum,</hi> if all theſe things bee in the land of the dead, what ſhall bee in the Land of the living?</p>
               <p>Againe, wee know that there bee three places in this life; the firſt is the Wombe, the ſecond, the World, the third, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: betweene theſe places there is a proportion: For Heaven is ſo much greater than the World, as the World is greater than the Wombe, and the more excellent, as well for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, as greatneſſe of place. As touching conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time, the firſt life is no longer than nine moneths, the ſecond life is foureſcore yeeres, the third is infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Furthermore the diverſity of dwellers in Heaven, and Earth, doe notably ſet forth unto us the difference of theſe two places: <hi>Haec terra plena peccatorum:</hi> this Earth is full of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13.</note>

Why drinke wee of broken Cyſternes, and not of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life? If wee had but a little ſight of this Heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; wee would deſpiſe Babylon, for in Heaven wee ſhall ſee God, and bee equall with the Angels; there wee ſhall partake of ſo great joyes, as no Geometrician can meaſure; ſo many, as no Arithmetician can number; and ſo wonderfull, as no Rhetorician can utter, had hee the tongue both of Men and Angels. <hi>O ineffabilis delectatio!</hi> O unſpeakeble delight! where God is their object, a looking glaſſe for their eyes, muſicke for their eares, hony for their taſte, ſweet balſome for their ſmell, a poſie of all delights for their Heavenly hands.

               <p>But to proceed.
